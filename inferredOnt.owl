Reviews
“In gaming land, players can be – and see – anything; the only limits are imagination. Aiming to take this concept to new dimensions is Tethys Interactive’s Astral Terra.”
IndieGameMag  “Morrowind meets Minecraft; that’s my first impression looking at this open-world 3D aRPG. The graphics are nicer than in either of these games, but it still manages to implement Minecraft’s world creation and destruction mechanics. That it does so in a truly alien-looking, open-ended fantasy world reminiscent of The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind is icing on the proverbial cake.”
Indie RPGs
 “With the constantly changing worlds there is no limit to the wonders that Astral Terra can provide. It’s rare that a game truly leaves me in awe of what they’re doing. Astral Terra is getting to that point. The thought of ever-changing worlds, that I can change on a whim is very intriguing. I hope it lives up to its potential.”

About This Content
							Purchase this character pack to add the Jester to your character collection. He is then available to choose in all game modes.

The Jester Stats -
Strength - 2
Craft - 4
Fate - 4
Lives - 5
Alignment - Good

Special Abilities (from the character card) -

When you are attacked by another character, your constant juggling causes a distraction and he must reduce his attack roll by 1 (to a minimum of 1).

Instead of attacking a character, you may impress him with your skills and take one gold from him.

Whenever you encounter a creature, you may try to confuse it. Roll one die and add your fate. If the total is higher than the creature&apos;s Strength or Craft, you may evade it. If you fail to confuse the creature, you must attack it as normal.

Whenever you visit the City, Tavern or Village, instead of encountering the space, you may perform there and earn one gold.

Whenever you visit the Castle, you may heal up to your life value for free.						</project:description>

About This Game
“Life is Feudal: Your Own” (LiF:YO) is a medieval life simulator for 64 players on a 3km x 3km gameworld. It places you in a realistic medieval setting with the ability to host your own private world and set your own rules. This world has free terraforming and building features. You can build your own house anywhere in the world! Team up with your friends and build a village or city and repel attacks by other players who want to steal your lands and slaughter your cattle! A good castle with tall city walls might help you protect yourselves and your precious valuables  
 Included in your purchase, all Life is Feudal:YO owners will receive one character to gain full access to early mmo testing in Q2 2016, and the full massively multiplayer game - Life is Feudal:MMO once released.
 The combat system in our game is quite unique; it is a non-target and physics-based combat system. The direction of your attack depends on mouse movement. Basic movements combined with directional attacks can be mixed together to create deadly combos with special harmful effects. Battle formations are a new way to collaborate and control the situation on the battlefield with your fighting team. Depending on the battle situation, a group leader must issue the right commands to manage formations during a battle. The more group members that make up a given formation, the bigger the advantages they enjoy. A well organized group will always prevail over a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off.
 True use of sandbox mechanics and not just the &quot;sandbox&quot; label being applied to the game. A great example is that player skill progression is not limited by artificial classes or roles. The Skill cap and Stat cap systems allow you to design a character, which fits your style of play perfectly. The crafting system contains a lot of sand and boxes too. :) An excellent example is how alchemy works almost the same way as it did in TES:Oblivion ©. The wikipedia and your friends won’t be able to help you because all the recipes are randomized for each character and the only way to learn them all is by experimentation.
 Farming will demand a sound understanding of different crops, soil fertilization and knowledge regarding when to plant or harvest your crops according to the current weather. An example of farming knowledge is knowing your crop fertilizer comes from your stables and barns, which you need to manage and clean in order to breed the best war horses on the continent! You will also need to feed and tend your other livestock as well. 
 Food is very important for character development and skill progression. The higher the quality and complexity of your meal, the faster you will progress through your skills. This places a cook on the same level of importance as other craftspeople such as blacksmiths, carpenters or alchemists.Features Unique Features:  Free Terraforming &amp; Tunnel Building. 100% free terraforming and tunnel building! Dig tunnels, mines and moats and expand them in all dimensions almost without limit! You can raise and lower ground levels with a landfall effect. Substances include soil, rock, granite, ore veins, clay, sand, and much more!
Battle Formation System. In massive battles you can react accordingly to the combat situation and provide your unit with certain bonuses, but to receive these bonuses, unit members must be well organized and always stay inside the formation shape.
Unlimited Number of Unique Alchemy Combinations. There are over 40,000,000 alchemy combinations unique to each player! Unlike other online games, you need to learn, experiment and create your very own unique combinations. Alchemy is not simply a matter of character skill as it strongly emphasises spending time and resources on creating good recipes and combinations.
Complex Food &amp; Cooking System. Cooking is no longer a secondary or non-existent skill. Being a good cook that knows many complex and tasty recipes means that you and your friends will be better fed and will receive skill bonuses!
Realistic Player Damage System. Based on human anatomy with fractures and bleeding wounds you can create unique and deadly combat tactics.
Double Health &amp; Stamina Bars. Double health and stamina bars represent better information about the status of your body. Players can be knocked unconscious or killed. They can also be temporarily out of breath or totally exhausted.

These are only a few features that are listed. Craft and construct hundreds of items and build unique structures to create the world around you. Your imagination will be your only limitation as hundreds of personal choices and customization will offer endless combinations in Life is Feudal: Your Own. </project:description>

8.7/10 – Multiplayer  “Clandestine is one of the best coop experiences we&apos;ve played so far. We&apos;ve loved working together with a friend, both as a hacker and as a spy.”

About This Game
 Captain eight highly detailed vessels and explore famous European ports including Dover, Rostock and the bay of Gibraltar. Larger vessels will break through the waves with tremendous force but smaller ships will rock back and forth creating a great experience as you try to combat realistic water physics.
   Each ship handles differently, some with different controls to master while others may have a sharp difference in acceleration and speed. Every ship contains a highly detailed bridge for you to explore in first person mode.
   Included is a detailed Mission editor which allows players to adjust wave height, create a selection of triggers and spawn AI ships. This game is a core product for the development team and will continue to be supported post launch with new updates and DLC.Features List Eight ships with highly detailed bridges and

“Dragon Fin Soup uses an adult oriented, light-hearted tone to disguise some brutally hard gameplay. One that I believe will turn out to be incredibly rewarding.”
Hardcore Gamer  “...there&apos;s an old-school zelda vibe crossed with tactical combat and crafting. That appeals.”
Rock Paper Shotgun  “There&apos;s just something about a drunken badass Red Riding Hood-esque character that&apos;s particularly amusing to me, and I&apos;m eager to see what exactly the highly irreverent team has come up with. Given that there was at least one scene in a rustic strip club, with a pole-dancing skeleton, it stands to reason that there will be a lot to enjoy in the rest of the narrative.”

About Euro Fishing   Euro Fishing immerses you deep into the adrenaline-packed action, fun and beauty of Europe’s most famous lakes. Master your rod, line and tactics, and refine your technique to become a top angler. This is the closest you can get to real fishing from the comfort of your own sofa. Welcome to the Great Indoors!
 Whether you’re a fishing beginner or angling pro, Euro Fishing accurately and authentically replicates the feeling of actual fishing using our unique physics-based casting and reeling system, ‘Total Cast Control’.
 Start by learning the basics of casting with in-game tutorials, or dive straight into one of the five unique European locations included, such as Digger Lakes and the famous St John’s Lake at Linear Fisheries, each posing their own unique challenge to land the big catch.
 Using advanced AI and customisable environment effects, fish respond to water temperature, time of day, weather conditions and baits as they do in real life. Spot fish ‘shows’ before casting into the right area from a pre-set peg or the lake bank, and customise your angling equipment for the best chance of landing a catch.
 In Euro Fishing, you can fish by yourself, or compete against friends and opponents in single player or hosted multiplayer tournaments, tracking and comparing catches in real time.
 Euro Fishing – Cast, Catch, Compete!

        <project:description>
About This Game
							Wave of Darkness invites you to a huge dark and gritty fantasy world which can be explored the way you want and whenever you want. Tired of killing monsters and solving quests on the east? You can go north and explore the region of Klesabia, Macabon or Ealonia, slay northern monsters  ... generally do whatever you desire.

Wave of Darkness is not your average casual action RPG. It is tailored for fans of hardcore old-school RPG titles, offering massive dark and gritty fantasy world which will challenge you at every step. The world of Narr is corrupted by the Dark Magic, and you will have to do your best to free land from this malicious deviance.

While most RPG titles offer very limited area for you to explore, restricting it by invisible walls, or simply with various design solutions, Wave of Darkness enables you to wander everywhere, and whenever you wish to do so. Of course, you can follow the strict path of the plot, and complete quests until you finish the game, or you can explore every bit and corner of Narr, meet various NPCs, complete side quests for them, and fight dangerous monsters. WOD offers 70+ hours of gameplay.

So you decided to start the game by creating a sword wielding character, but after a while you realize swords aren&apos;t really your thing. Wave of Darkness enables you to combine and experiment different character classes, which means you can have a powerful melee/ranged or ranged/magic character, even if you made a mistake by choosing a character class that doesn&apos;t fit your RPG affinities, without the need to start the game all over again. WoD enables you to combine, explore and experiment with character classes however you want, without limitations. But it&apos;s still recommended to keep in mind the basics of RPG, so try to create solid and meaningful characters because the game will definitely challenge you.						</project:description>

About This Game
Story
After the death of his mother, Tomoya Okazaki—a guarded delinquent student at Hikarizaka High School—struggles to not only make sense of the abusive relationship he has with his alcoholic father, but also find meaning in his life. While on his way to class one morning, he meets a mystifying girl named Nagisa. She is a delinquent like him, but only because she is repeating her senior year, unlike the perpetually tardy Okazaki. From their brief encounter, Nagisa decides they should be friends, and enlists Tomoya&apos;s help to revive the school drama club. Not being busy in any way, he decides to join in. Along the way, the two make friends with many other students and try to find both solace and belonging in their endeavors.New Features HD Upgrade All visuals have been upgraded to 1280x960 for the Steam release of CLANNAD.

About This Content
							A workhorse of German and Polish railways, the BR 24 ‘Steppenpferd’ comes to Train Simulator from Romantic Railroads.
 The ‘Steppenpferd’ (‘Prairie Horse’) was developed specifically for the long, flat routes in West and East Prussia between 1928 and 1940 as passenger locomotives. The Deutsche Reichsbahn soon pressed these heavy steam engines into service and they served the DR well until the outbreak of World War II.
 During wartime, a number of the locomotives were moved to Poland, where 34 remained after 1945 and re-classified as Oi2 by the PKP. These locomotives served until the last was withdrawn in 1976. Of the remaining locomotives, 47 were taken on by the Deutsche Bundesbahn and retired by 1968. Four locomotives were left with the DR following WWII and withdrawn from services in the 1970s.
 In total, four examples have been preserved – three in Germany and one in Poland.
 The BR 24 for Train Simulator is available in black livery and features cab lighting, accurately recreated steam simulation (including simulated boiler explosion) and functioning PZB90 in-cab signalling, plus custom route assets including a loco shed, water crane and coaling &amp; sanding tower.
 The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the DR BR 24 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Hamburg-Hanover route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).Scenarios Five scenarios for the Hamburg-Hanover route:
 	BR 24 Standard Tutorial
	BR 24 Expert Tutorial
	BR 24 Expert PZB 2 Tutorial
	Museum Uelzen
	Going Home
 More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game. Train Simulator’s Steam Workshop scenarios are free and easy to download, adding many more hours of exciting gameplay. With scenarios being added daily, why don’t you check it out now!

About This Content
							As the first diesel locomotives to be built at BR’s Darlington Works, the Class 24 was built as part of the British Rail Modernisation Plan in the late 1950s.
 The Class 24 was a Sulzer Type 2, Bo-Bo diesel-electric locomotive built between 1958 and 1961, incorporating numerous elements such as off-the-shelf standardised components used for manufacture, including a Sulzer 6LDA28 diesel engine and a 735Kw British Thomson-Houston (BTH) electric transmission, producing a total of 1,160hp resulting in a top speed of 75mph (120km/h).
 Built at BR’s Derby, Crewe and Darlington Works, Class 24s could be seen running services initially around Derby and Crewe, but eventually across the British Rail network hauling both passenger and freight. Fifteen of the original 20 locomotives were put into use on the Southern Region as the Kent Coast electrification scheme was behind schedule, and could also be spotted in the Eastern Region, London Midland Region, Wales and Lancashire.
 Class 24s also took over Condor freight services from London to Glasgow, replacing Class 28s, and became the foundation for the later Class 25 model.
 The first Class 24 to be withdrawn from service was D5051 in November 1967 and by 1979, all but three Class 24s had been withdrawn from service, 14 of which were scrapped before receiving a TOPS number. The final locomotive, 24081, was withdrawn in October 1980.
 Today, only four of the Class have survived into preservation, D5032 and D5061 at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, D5054 at the East Lancashire Railway and 24081 at the Gloucestershire &amp; Warwickshire Railway.
 The BR Class 24 for Train Simulator recreates the locomotive as it operated for British Railways throughout the UK in the 1960s, and is available in British Railways corporate blue/grey livery. Also included are BR Mk1 coaches in corporate blue/grey livery and 40T YGH ‘Sealion’ ballast wagons.
 The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BR Class 24 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Weardale &amp; Teesdale Network route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).Scenarios Three scenarios for the Weardale &amp; Teesdale Network route:
 	Mickleton to Darlington

About This Content
							Once a record-breaking steam locomotive admired by many on the UK’s rail network, the LMS Coronation Class ‘Duchess of Hamilton’ comes to Train Simulator in its striking streamlined variant.
 The LMS Coronation Class was a mainline steam locomotive designed by William Stanier and built at Crewe Works between 1937 and 1948. In total, 38 were produced and are the most powerful steam locomotives ever built in the UK, with an impressive 3,333hp - more than the diesel traction that replaced them in later years.
 The first five locomotives built in the Class were painted in Caledonian Railway blue with sliver stripes to match the coaches for the Coronation Scot service, for which they were designed for. They also featured streamlining, designed by Tom Coleman, the streamlining mainly added as a publicity stunt. However, Stanier believed the added weight, increased difficulty for maintenance and the fact that it just wasn’t effective at lower speeds, didn’t make it worthwhile.
 In 1937 during speed trials, Coronation Class No. 6220 reached an impressive 114 mph (183km/h) south of Crewe, setting a new record speed at the time. However, shortly after reaching this speed, the locomotive entered a series of crossover points and with insufficient braking distance, entered the crossover too fast. Fortunately, the locomotive remained on the rails but destroyed most of the crockery inside the coaches. As a consequence, record-breaking runs were deemed too dangerous for passengers, crew and trains alike, and they were subsequently banned.
 The second batch of five Coronations was also streamlined, apart from the more traditional Crimson Lake with gold stripes livery, one such locomotive being No. 6229 ‘Duchess of Hamilton’. The ‘Duchess’ was built in 1938 and was the last in the Coronation Class to be built with streamlining. Nine years later, ‘Duchess of Hamilton’ had its streamlining removed and smoke deflectors added.
 Today, three Coronation Class locomotives have been preserved, No. 6229 ‘Duchess of Hamilton’, No. 6233 ‘Duchess of Sutherland’ and No. 6235 ‘City of Birmingham’. ‘Duchess of Sutherland’ remains in mainline service on railtours around the UK, while ‘City of Birmingham’ and ‘Duchess of Hamilton’ are static displays in museums, the latter alongside LNER A4 Class ‘Mallard’ at the National Railway Museum in York, resplendent in its original streamlining.
 The Coronation Class ‘Duchess of Hamilton’ for Train Simulator is available in LMS Crimson Lake livery with gold stripes, and includes Mk1 passenger coaches in LMS Maroon Lined (late crest) livery.
 The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the LMS Coronation Class (Streamlined) ‘Duchess of Hamilton’ on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Settle to Carlisle route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).Scenarios Three scenarios for the Settle to Carlisle route:
 	Vintage Train: Part 1
	Vintage Train: Part 2
	Vintage Train: The Return

About This Content
							The CEA conversion was one of the later attempts to find a use for the large numbers of HEA hoppers that were standing around with very little to do as the requirements for domestic and industrial coal diminished. The CEAs were converted in 1996 by the shadow privatisation company Loadhaul with a retractable sheet that could be rolled back from ground level by attaching a windlass to a spigot fitted to the under-frame. The sheet allowed the CEAs to carry products which needed protecting from the weather or that may have had issues with dust blowing off in transit. Interestingly a thin corner support was added to the later build wagons at the time of conversion which led to a little bit of confusion at one point in the development of this expansion!
 Some 44 wagons were converted and they appear to have had questionable success in traffic. Some commodities that the wagons have been noted carrying include Limestone, Calcified Seaweed, China Clay, Petroleum Coke and Chipped Tyres for use at Aberthawe Cement Works.
 Following the sale of the three shadow privatisation companies to Wisconsin Central the CEA hoppers became the responsibility of English Welsh and Scottish Railway. The company was very pro-active in attempting to grow rail freight across the United Kingdom, both in terms of block train and wagonload traffic. EWS obviously saw some value in the CEA fleet and a large number received a coat of EWS maroon along with new matching flexible covers.
 Oddly, for such a small fleet of wagons the repainting wasn’t uniform and two distinct styles appeared. In one case the wagons received EWS maroon on the hopper body area only, the lettering and notices were in the same style applied to the wagons when converted by Loadhaul and no EWS branding was carried. Other wagons also received maroon paint on the top face of the under-frame and on the buffer beams, EWS branding was applied and other lettering above under-frame level was moved and applied in gold using Gill Sans.
 The EWS CEA Covered Hopper Wagon Pack for Train Simulator includes:
 	Branded and unbranded EWS liveries.
	Clean and weathered versions of both wagon body and livery types
	Loaded and unloaded versions with suitable physics. Other features include:
	‘Intelligent’ tail lamps
	Animated hand brakes
	Body variation switching based on vehicle number as per the prototype.
 The pack includes a user manual with further details about the rolling stock and the customising of some of the features when using the wagons in scenarios.						</project:description>

        <project:description>
About This Content
							In 1971, a new design of long wheel base van appeared from Ashford Works that had the same overall dimensions as earlier air braked vans, but they were fitted with 2 centrally mounted sliding doors per side and were Air-braked only. These 125 wagons to lot 3764 were coded as COV CD and painted Freight Brown with a large Double Arrow high on the left hand side. In the 2nd half of 1974, Shildon Works constructed a further 100 vans to lot 3832. It is these 2 lots of wagons that feature in this pack.
 After the changeover to TOPS, these vans were coded as VCA, though the 2nd lot were incorrectly labelled as VBA when new (not featured in the pack). In time, the first lot were repainted in Maroon livery with a boxed Double Arrow and Railfreight branding. Both lots later received Railfreight Flame Red &amp; Grey livery.
 The VCAs seem to have been mainly used for tinplate traffic from South Wales to various Metal Box Company factories around the country and for export traffic. From the early 1980s many of the vans were transferred to departmental use or were used as the base for further wagon types, but these are outside the scope of this pack.
The VCA 45t GLW 2 axle vans Wagon Pack for Train Simulator includes
 	BR Freight Brown, BR Maroon and BR Railfreight flame red &amp; grey liveries
	Clean and weathered textures
	Loaded and unloaded versions with suitable physics.
	‘Intelligent’ tail lamps

About This Content
							With the decline in domestic and industrial coal traffic as a consequence of switching many energy needs to natural gas British Rail found themselves with a surplus of relatively new air braked coal hoppers. These hoppers (TOPS code HEA) had been constructed in the late 1970s to enable facilities that were unable to handle merry-go-round trains to be served using modern wagons. With a surplus of HEA wagons available a number of different experiments were undertaken to try and find useful work for the underused assets.
 One of the conversions which were attempted with the HEA hoppers from 1987 was for scrap traffic as there was a distinct shortage of suitable wagons at the time. This shortage was possibly as a consequence of the removal of vacuum braked and unfitted trains from the network which meant that the 16T mineral wagons that had previously been used for scrap traffic were no longer available. It should also be remembered that at this time British Rail were actively encouraging customers to own or lease their wagons rather than them being supplied by the railway.
 With this situation in mind, a very basic conversion of HEA hoppers was attempted for scrap traffic. The main aim of the conversion was to produce a flat bottomed wagon and to take the hoppers out of use as loading and unloading at scrap processors would be via mechanical grabs and magnets. This flat bottom was achieved in two ways, either a steel plate was welded across the bottoms of the hoppers at approximately under-frame height or a similar level of ballast was dropped into the wagon. The latter wagons can be identified by an increased tare weight that was patch painted on to the data panel.
Inevitably the end of Speedlink saw the end of the majority traffic for which the wagons had been converted but some do appear to have remained in use well into the 1990s.
 The HSA Scrap Wagon Pack for Train Simulator includes weathered maroon and weathered Railfreight red/grey liveries, in loaded and unloaded states with suitable physics. 
 	Other features include: 
	Intelligent tail lamps
	Animated hand brake lever
	Variable infill method with tare weight patch
	Five different logo styles randomly applied with overrides
	Variable load planes randomly applied
	Body switching dependent on vehicle number with reference to end ladders on earlier vehicles
	Randomised textures of Railfreight red/grey versions

The pack includes a user manual with further details about the rolling stock and the customising of some of the features when using the wagons in scenarios.						</project:description>

        <project:description>
About This Content
							One of the features of railway operation until the mid-1990s was the requirement for trains carrying ‘Dangerous Goods’ to be formed with barrier wagons to help protect the crew in the event of a collision by increasing distance from the cargo (for safety reasons or at least due to Union pressure) and providing a ‘crumple zone’ in the event of low to medium speed rear end collision. In the case of the relatively short nuclear flask trains the additional vehicles provided extra brake force allowing the train to avoid having to run at restricted speed. Trains conveying ‘Dangerous Goods’ were also required to have a Guard in attendance to lay detonators to protect the train in the event of derailment or collision and a brake van would often be provided to avoid having to pass the load in the event of spillage.
 Traditionally any available wagon would be used as a barrier wagon, but no doubt with sectorisation in the run up to privatisation it was felt this should be a tangible (and accountable) resource. As a consequence two wagon design sheets were issued in 1989 for the conversion of HEA hoppers to RNA barrier wagons by the removal of the hoppers and the fitting a floor at Carlise Currock wagon works creating some thirty cut down barrier wagons. This fleet was then further enlarged by nine more conversions which were generally re-coded as RNA but retained their bodies, some of these wagons were never officially reclassified as RNA even though allocated to Nuclear Barrier traffic.
 The RNA Barrier Wagon Pack for Train Simulator includes a full-bodied hopper variant in weathered Railfreight red/grey livery, weathered maroon and clean Railfreight grey/yellow coal sector liveries. The cut down hopper variant with added floor is finished in clean Railfreight yellow/grey coal sector livery.
 Other features include:
 	Animated handbrake lever
	Intelligent flashing early style battery tail lamp
	Randomised decals with overrides on maroon and Railfreight flame red and grey versions
 This pack also includes the CAR Brake Van [RF Sector] Pack as a free download, enabling scenario writers to place an appropriate brake van at the end of each train. The CAR Brake Van (from dia. 1/507) is finished in clean Railfreight Sector livery and includes dynamically smoking and non-smoking stove pipe versions, selectable trainload freight sector decals and intelligent flashing early style battery tail lamp. 
 Both packs include a user manual with further details about the rolling stock and the customising of some of the features when using the wagons in scenarios.						</project:description>

“I wasn’t familiar with Wakfu or Dofus before playing Krosmaster Arena but I was so impressed with the world and the art that I installed Wakfu a couple nights ago. It’s fair to say they’ve got me hooked.”
Penny Arcade  “Krosmaster is played on a gridded board with fantastic-looking anime-style miniatures. The characters are diverse and fantastical, including an adorable grim reaper, the queen of tofu, and the king of overly aggressive sheep (if you&apos;re familiar with MMO strategy games Dofus or Wakfu, you&apos;ll see familiar faces).”
Game Informer  “Between the emphasis on PvP (but with a very robust PvE too) and on collecting figurines, this game should be perfect for those who like CCGs.”

About This Game
Trouble In The Manor is an online multiplayer game which takes place in a spooky far away manor. You are designated one of three roles upon each round: innocent, bloodhound, or murderer.
 If you&apos;re INNOCENT, your job is to seek out murderers by any means necessary, finding any items on the manor grounds to aid other innocents and calling a hit on murderers once you have enough evidence or killing them yourself.
 BLOODHOUNDS are the same as innocents with the exception that they have an advantage with DNA devices that allow them to compare DNA against bodies they&apos;ve found or any DNA that is left in an area by a murderer.
 If you&apos;re a MURDERER, your job is to kill every innocent and bloodhound in the round as they can. They have a selection of items they can buy in the store with currency found within the manor. These items range from weapons to traps to disguising devices.
 A MURDERER also has the choice of transforming into a VAMPIRE by awakening the vampire that sleeps in the basement coffin. Vampires can turn other innocents into vampires and help the murderers quest for blood.
 Work together, trust no one.						</project:description>

About This Content
							The Airport Southwest Florida International is located on the south-western coast of Florida and is the second busiest single-runway airport in the U.S. handling around 8 million passengers.
The first plans for building this airport date back to 1973; ten years later it opened as “Southwest Florida Regional Airport”. In 1993 it got its present name. At the same time the runway was expanded from 8,400 ft to 12,000 ft. Since then, the airport has been expanded several times. For example, in 2005 a new terminal building was opened after the old one had exceeded its capacity by factor 2.
 This model of the Southwest Florida Intl Airport for X-Plane 10 offers a highly detailed reproduction of the real airport thanks to its 10cm/pixel aerial image and 1cm/pixel ground layout. The developer made sure to use non-repetitive textures. Baked night illumination and ambient occlusion as well as HDR lighting complete the visual impression, while static aircraft, road traffic and both animated and static apron vehicles create a lively area. Additionally, the scenery is compatible with the AutoGate plug-in, adding animated jet bridges and marshallers at all gates, as well as with the HD Mesh Scenery by Andras Fabian.
Product DescriptionFeatures 10 cm/pixel aerial ortho imagery covering the entire airport (approx. 8.41 sq. km)
1 cm/pixel custom ground detail/markings
Baked-in, ray-traced ambient occlusion on all major buildings
Baked-in, ray-traced night illumination on the airport terminal building
Specular reflections and all-HDR lighting
Accurate building heights, measured using LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) elevation data
Designed using X-Plane 10-native methods for maximum performance
Animated jet bridges and marshallers at all gates (using the freely available AutoGate plugin by Jonathan Harris)
Static aircraft as an option
Animated and static ground vehicles
Volumetric grass
Road traffic

“one hell of an impressive puzzle game.”
8.3 / 10 – IGN  “The gameplay is addictive, the visuals are attractive, and it&apos;s well suited to play on the go.”
7.5 / 10 – Gamespot  “It&apos;s a nearly brilliant (and obscenely adorable) blend of puzzle solving, strategic item usage, and Rube Goldberg-like mechanisms.”
4 / 5 – Games Radar

 About the game  The game was planned as an old-school tower defense game (like Blizzard&apos;s tower-defense map in Frozen Throne), but with a twist.
 We wanted the game to have an immersive story and the first half of it to be a circle-tower-defense-game, meaning that the monsters will not vanish in a portal of some sort, but stay on the screen until you have destroyed them, or there are 100 of them on the screen (in which case you have lost).
 But other than that, no bells and whistles, just basic action, but neatly balanced, good controls and not too easy.
 The games controls are RTS-like (that means, that you control a hero, who will do most of the work in-game) and the second half of the levels will change the gameplay to a standard tower-defense game.

About This Game
							Dan McPenrite&apos;s sister Merle has dropped off the grid without notice. Reports indicate that this is a fate she shares with countless others. 

Set in the near future where virtual reality has become the ultimate escape to the dreariness and suffering of everyday life in a collapsing society you will use your wits, computer skills, and hacking ability to discover the mystery behind the recent disappearances. This investigation leads you to infiltrate her last known location where you become entangled in a conspiracy that spans both virtual and physical realities. Do you have what it takes to find your sister and help her before it is to late? 

The initial concept of this game was created by a published author in the hacking world. The story has been written by Conor Kostick - Published Sci-Fi author and Historian.						</project:description>

About This Content
Be a bus driver! Have you ever dreamt of being a bus driver? Well, now you can take your seat behind the steering wheel of faithfully recreated service buses of the “Wiener Linien”! Fully functional cockpits with lots of animations and realistic sounds ensure high authenticity and create a simulation with the true flair of Vienna!
 “Wien 1 – Line 24A” is the first of two add-ons for OMSI 2 placed in Vienna. It includes the route of Line 24A in different variants and traffic routings as well as the appropriate articulated busses of high-floor and low-floor generations. 
 The interesting and challenging routing has been modeled in a true-to-original way with many objects and details and offers prolonged driving pleasure for beginners and advanced drivers alike.
The buses are completely animated and include lots of functions of the everyday bus rides such as original announcements! AI-controlled passenger cars, buses, trains, trams and subways can be encountered on the route thereby putting the finishing touches on the scenery.
 Perfect interplay An ideal complement to this add-on is “Wien 2 – Line 23A”: The rigid buses that operate on Line 23A start out from the same point of departure as those on Line 24A. Together, both add-ons ensure great variety and driving fun for many, many hours!Features Articulated bus NL 205 M12 (first low-floor generation) 
Articulated bus LU 200 M11 (last high-floor generation) 
Route Vienna – Line 24A until the year 2005 up to Kagran 
New routing Vienna – Line 24A since 2006 up to “Kagraner Platz“ 
Lots of new objects and street models 
Real streets and buildings – maximum of authenticity 
Many different routings with original timetables 
Original „Wiener Linien“ bus stop announcements 
AI tram Type E1-c3 and Type ULF 
AI subway Type U 
All vehicles are original replicas of the “Wiener Linien” 
New AI cars and AI motorbikes, perfectly animated – for the first time in OMSI’s traffic

About This Content
							Gorgon is a devious, hideous killer who enjoys watching her prey struggle. Her ranged attacks can deal damage over time and are menacing when focused on a single Hunter. Traversing across the map quickly with her Web Sling, Gorgon can also stick to walls and hide or rain down attacks from above.
Acid SpitCoats target in burning acid and can be sprayed onto the environment making areas painful for Hunters to cross.
Web SnareSlows target’s movement while dealing damage, making Hunters easy prey for additional attacks.
The SpiderThis trap can be deployed at range. When Hunters come near, the spider captures them and carries them away while slowly digesting them.
MimicGorgon sheds this glowing husk and controls it remotely; traversing, melee attacking and manually detonating like a remote controlled bomb.						</project:description>

Reviews
“Build letting bots reshape the landscape by dropping tetrominoes, which puts a nuanced and entertaining twist on the basic artillery formula, particularly as battles run longer.”
RockPaperShotgun  “Mayan Death Robots is easily one of the best games we have played all year. Not only does it improve and sometimes re-imagine the formula for this type of game but the sheer amount of content is amazing.”
5/5 – Nerd Age  “While Mayan Death Robots shares a lot in common with Worms, it also innovates enough that it is an entertaining experience for anyone who enjoyed the Worms franchise.”

About This Game
							It&apos;s the year 2112. A hundred years following the apocalypse, humans quickly rebuilt a new world while developing science and technology. Earth, at this time, became a perfect Eden. Despite this, humans continued to be possessed of madness and desire. Wars, crime, and killings still continued.

In 2113, due to the demand for new weapons of war, a program surrounding cybernetic technology was initiated. A group of specially selected girls was sent to a secret research facility for body modifications.

In 2115, a mysterious meteorite from deep space was detected approaching the Solar System. Some scientists predicted it would hit the Earth in three years. Humans were so afraid that they tried everything they could to prevent this from happening.

In 2116, analysis of the incoming meteorite revealed something even more frightening: the presence of many unknown life forms and suspected viral substances on the meteorite. Even if humanity survived the meteorite hitting the Earth, the world would be destroyed due to these mysterious life forms and viruses.

About This Content
  Their horsemen ride like thunder across the plain, like the kings of old! The Jackal &amp; The Khan DLC adds an additional Crusader Trail campaign and a duo of new AI opponents. Two men destined to lead their forces across the wilds of the desert plain, The Jackal and The Khan are outcast warriors forced to survive on their wits and the loyalty of their men. Both nomads in their own way, the animalistic Khan and the fearless Jackal represent the ultimate challenge for Stronghold players. The latest character pack DLC for Stronghold Crusader 2, The Jackal &amp; The Khan adds nine new missions, two AI opponents, achievements, custom in-game shields and castle designs unique to these new Lords.The Jackal   A skilled warlord who shields his face behind by a large metal helm, fashioned in the shape of a jackal’s head, Crusader 2 returns The Jackal to his homeland. After The Wolf is impaled and thrown from his tower at the end of the original Stronghold (2001) he is taken east, where he is miraculously restored to health by The Jackal and his allies. After mending his broken bones The Jackal eventually becomes The Wolf’s subordinate, earning his master&apos;s trust by killing the King and replacing The Pig as chief warlord. Unlike The Pig or indeed The Rat, The Jackal appears unafraid of The Wolf. Disagreeing with orders and seeking to provide counsel in his own way, The Jackal challenges The Wolf as an equal. After his military campaign against The Boy fails, The Jackal chooses to desert his stubborn leader and return to his native lands. Here he bides his time, exacting revenge on those who wronged him when the moment is opportune.The Khan   The Khan is a nomad closely connected to his lands, both in terms of his past and play style. For most of his adult life The Khan has acted as head for his pack of roaming soldiers. More travelling warriors than mercenaries seeking to turn a profit, The Khan&apos;s men are in search of a good fight and glorious victories. Over the years The Khan&apos;s leadership has taken his makeshift army between lands with no permanent home or base of operations, always more interested in the journey and victories secured along the way. His army is animalistic and wild, operating in packs and always seeking out new resources to plunder.DLC Features New Missions - Lead the pack to victory with nine new single-player missions in &apos;The Jackal &amp; The Khan&apos; Skirmish Trail.
Two Characters - The Jackal and The Khan enter the fray as AI opponents in a new Crusader Trail, Skirmish Mode and Multiplayer.
Unique Castles - Inventive wall layouts, ample siege defenses and some of the strongest fortifications in the game.
Custom Shields - Customize your in-game shield with five new designs, representing the paths of the warlord and the nomad.
Extra Achievements - Discover new Steam achievements and set yourself apart as a true master of warfare. Please Note: The Jackal and The Khan is downloadable add-on content, requiring the full Stronghold Crusader 2 game on Steam to play.						</project:description>

							Embark on a tour of Ian Vincent&apos;s India and discover one of the most densely populated and colorful countries of the world. The year is 1911, and the world is changing fast in the British Raj. Will you complete your Grand Tour in time, or lose to more cunning – or simply better connected – opponents?
 Ticket to Ride now supports vertical maps! The map India is the first vertical map made available. This vertical map brings a new way of playing by introducing loops called mandalas. On this map players who decide to reach two cities through mandalas i.e. connecting two cities following loops will get more points.						</project:description>

 These calls offer improved situational awareness for pilots in an effort to help reduce the risk of runway incursions and accidents by providing aural alerts during taxi, take-off, final approach and landing/roll-out operations.
 User options give control over RAAS and allow for complete customization to match specific needs.
 The software is professional grade, highly configurable, and is ideal for power users who want to model airline-specific options and who want maximum control over how RAAS functions in FSX: Steam Edition.Full Aurals Modelled  	Approaching runway

About This Game
 Lock and Load! It&apos;s time to KickAss and... Well, it&apos;s just time to KickAss. Grab your machinegun, flamethrower, rocket launcher and grenades. Assault the enemy base and free commandos to join your team while you destroy everything you see. Make your way through enemy bunkers to rescue your comrades, and kill everyone else you encounter!     KickAss Action  Weather Forecast: Bullet Storm with Hail of Grenades  Explosions. Big, Big Explosions.  Did we mention the Explosions?  Grenades, Flamethrowers, Machineguns, Rocket Launchers      Colonel Stone is the leader of the KickAss Commandos. He is tough as nails and takes no crap from anyone. If you want to be a KickAss Commando under his command, you personally owe him 100 pairs of boots taken from the bodies of 100 dead enemies!     Lex Lightning - Men want to be him, and women want to be with him. The magic of his mustache simply drives the women crazy, and his prowess on the battlefield makes his enemies shrink like your balls in a winter speedo.    Sgt. Mohawk is by far the strongest commando. He once pulled a broken down tank to the top of the hill to use it as his personal shoulder-mounted rocket launcher.    Corporal Flame is also known as the “hottest” Commando, but that’s not because of his looks. He’s used his flamethrower to torch enemies across the globe.    Corporal Muscles is so proud of his chiseled physique that he never wears a shirt, not even on missions in the arctic.    Lieutenant Newbie is the newest officer to join the Commandos. Rumor has it the only way he made it  to the Commandos is because his family is connected to the highest levels of the government. He has a lot to prove if he wants to be accepted by the other Commandos.    Delta Ops - If we told you anything about these super secretive, elite forces, we’d have to kill you. So we’ll leave it at that.    Nameless Privates - Don’t bother to get to know them, because they probably won’t last long. Great for clearing minefields, going around dangerous corners, or just about any place bullets might fly.       General Irons is the unquestioned, totalitarian leader of the elite Tiger Division. During battle, he can usually be found sitting up high in a tower or on a wall directing his legion of soldiers and firing rockets into oncoming foes. He has made a blood oath to one day personally kill Colonel Stone with his bare hands!
    Major Schwarz was totally incompetent and dropped every weapon he ever held, so they promoted him up the chain of command and gave him a crate of grenades. He’s not accurate, but he’s got butterfingers and grenades in volume.
    Before joining the most evil enemy organization on the planet, the Commandant was know as the world’s most deadly assassin. General Irons personally recruited him to head up the Division’s secret operations battalion.
    Red Devils usually work in squads of 5 or more basterds. They all wield powerful shotguns to spray waves of deadly bullets at their foes. 
    Rumor has it the Fire Strikers snort lines of cayenne pepper before charging into battle with flamethrowers, setting fire to everything in their path. Entire cities have been burned to the ground by these faceless, ruthless killers.    Killer Snipers are deadly for miles away. The combination of their next-gen, high powered rifles, along with their genetically modified “eagle eyes” makes them one of the world’s most accurate and efficient killers. Use cover such as trees, trucks, or even nameless privates to get close enough to take them out.    Troopers are plentiful and disposable. These guys are a dime a dozen. Nobody wants to be killed by the standard enemy lackeys, so if you fall to them in battle make sure you eat one of your own grenades so nobody knows!    The Rocket Brothers are the most feared tandem of killers the world has ever seen. These brothers are giants among men and carry rocket launchers that fire 5 rockets at a time. If someone feels the need to have a rocket launcher that big, does it mean they&apos;re trying to compensate for something else being too small?    Inside every enemy Tank is a tiny little baddie who wasn’t brave enough to fight like a man, and that just won’t do. It’s your job to pry them open like canned beans and put the smack down. </project:description>

About This Content
							The fourth expansion for Construction Simulator 2015 includes a special highlight! The most comprehensive expansion to date, this addition will allow you to undertake the complex construction of a bridge, as well as a complete wind turbine.
 You will of course need the right equipment for these special challenges! The fourth expansion includes two new machines for your already extensive motor pool. The realistic Liebherr LR1300 crawler crane is the right choice for such a challenging undertaking. This crane will allow you to lift extremely heavy loads high into the air, and yet remain mobile even when the loads are attached. For the safe transport of the crawler crane, you will also receive a heavy transport trailer for your MAN tractor truck included in the expansion.
 As soon as you have downloaded the DLC, the additional contents will be available from the vehicle dealer. Keep in mind that you will need to have enough money in the game to buy the machines.
 You do not need to purchase the expansion in order to continue playing with your friends in multiplayer mode. However, you wull not be able to use the new vehicles yourself or begin the new missions on your own.
 NOTE: You require the main game Construction Simulator 2015 to use this expansion!Features: New machines: Original Liebherr Crawler Crane LR1300 with a corresponding heavy transport trailer

About This Game
  Spellsworn is an Online Player vs. Player Arena Game. It is a place where wizards and magical creatures use their wits and spells to wage war in an everchanging arena. Prove yourself in the arena and battle with all who dare call themselves your peers. Victory and pride outweighs reason and diplomacy, thus any debate between wizards is indistinguishable from outright warfare. Alliances will be broken, lives will be lost and the world will crumble. Will you remain, towering over the ashes?
 Spellsworn is heavily inspired by classic arena games such as DotA, League of Legends, Super Smash Bros. and traditional sumo-wrestling. Most of all however; Spellsworn is inspired by the user-created mod Warlock, made in Warcraft III.
    Spells

Each round you, the spellsworn, will recieve some coins to fund your battle. A shop stocked full of spells will serve as your arsenal as you prepare for the next battle round. It&apos;s imperative that you choose your spells carefully, as they may be completely countered by your enemy if you&apos;re not careful. There&apos;s very little grace to be had when standing with your pants down and no way of counterattacking your enemy&apos;s barrage of destruction.
   Game modes

There&apos;s plenty of ways to play Spellsworn. If you enjoy playing in teams and making up sick combos and rediculous plays with friends then maybe 2v2, 3v3 or 2v2v2 is for you. If you&apos;re more of a strong independent lonewolf then 1v1 is also fully supported (including all of the FFA variations, i.e 1v1v1v1 and so on). In the future we&apos;re hoping to include workshop support for your own scripted gamemodes and playstyles.
     Matchmaking and progression

Spellsworn will definitely have a competitive side to it - which means ranked plays and matchmaking is a must. It will likely follow the Elo standard that is used in many established e-sports games today. There will be a leveling system as well which will progress as you complete matches. Stats will be recorded during each session so that you can follow your progression along and track how well you&apos;re doing compared to past games.
   Forums

If you want to connect with us and discuss mad strats or other unrelated topics with people from the community, we do have a public forum over at http://www.reddit.com/r/spellsworn as well as the forum here on steam. Join us and give feedback. Let us know what you like and what you dislike so we can work together to make this an awesome game for everyone.

About This Game
In the rush to invent, conquer, and create, the ultimate consequences are sometimes forgotten.  Earth lies in ruin. Our ever advancing Aether technology opened a rift to another time, unleashing an ancient beast upon the galaxy. Known as the Destroyer, this massive creature travels from world to world devouring the Aether in planet cores only to leave a dead shell in its wake.
 You play as a Galactic Cadet, tasked with traveling to hostile planets in search of precious resources before The Destroyer rips through the planet core. Team up with friends, gather resources, and craft powerful gear on your home planet so you can aid the fight to save the galaxy!Features:   Explore Procedurally Generated Worlds: Each world is generated as you and your Combat Squad beam down. With exotic creatures, hostile monsters, and unique ores and vegetation, each planet provides a different experience and challenge that will test your skill and knowledge of survival in Roguelands.
  Unique Crafting System Gathering resources in Roguelands is unlike any other game. Instead of using a pickaxe or a hatchet to gather resources from ore deposits and trees, you command your Droids to do all of the work for you! Droids have different passive abilities and can cut down trees, mine ores, gather herbs, and even fight for you in combat. Once you&apos;ve acquired 10 pieces of any loot, you can craft an Emblem. Combine any 3 Emblems at the Gear Forge to acquire a new piece of gear and expand your recipe log!
  Permanent Death, but Permanent Progress Upon death your Galactic Cadet will die: losing all weapons, armor, and loot in their inventory. But anything that you&apos;ve stored back on your ship will remain persistent across ALL of your characters! After tons of character deaths you&apos;ll have permanently unlocked new Races, Variants, Augments, and Starting Uniforms that you can mix and match to create a unique play style. Also, any upgrades to your ship and saved NPCs will be permanent, so your new characters can have access to all of your hard earned resources!
  Master Every Weapon Type &amp; Variant: Roguelands features tons of exciting weapon types that players can experiment with. By progressing further through the galaxy by slaying monsters and crafting items, players will unlock new weapon variants with unique stats and randomly generated augments. Craft the perfect piece of gear through combining and forging!
  Collect All Combat Chips: Every Galactic Cadet can equip up to five Combat Chips before beaming out to a planet. These special augments can provide not only passive buffs for you and your squad, but also active abilities such as teleportation or enabling the use of Darkfire. Through exploration of both hostile planets and neutral cities and towns, players will amass a collection of these powerful chips and enable a variety of playstyles and character archetypes.
  Unlock the Secrets Behind the Destroyer &amp; the Scourge: The more NPCs you save, the more knowledge you&apos;ll acquire about the galaxy&apos;s chaotic and mysterious history. Where did the Destroyer come from? What is its true purpose? </project:description>

About This Game
							Summer break, a time to relax and have fun. But what&apos;s the difference between a good summer and a great summer? Spending money, of course! And what better way to earn some extra cash than a car wash? Unfortunately, the local branch of Ninja Car Washing Corp. is right across the street and they don’t appreciate the competition...
 Wash cars quickly to keep your customers happy and keep the money coming in. But beware! Those pesky ninja will do everything they can to run you out of business. You’ll need to use your wits, reflexes, and collection of basic car washing tools to defend against their attacks while keeping your customers happy.
 Learn to wield powerful items like the Garden Hose, Giant Sponge, and Reptile Wax both to clean cars and fend off the attacking ninja! You’ll start by defending against simple threats like muddy water balloons and exploding shuriken, but prove yourself superior to such petty tricks and your reputation will grow, earning you more customers and more attention from your enemies. Use the money earned to upgrade your stand and buy new gear such as the Polishing Cloth, Textured Sponge, and Fire Hose then put that equipment to work, taking on bigger jobs and fighting off mud firing bazookas, ninja assassins, and the dreaded trained pigeon attack squad!
 Features: Action/Casual Gameplay
A hilarious story with hours of fun!
Three fast and furious arcade modes for endless replay value!
Over 25 different tools and upgrades for your car wash!
Over 20 different ninja to fight!
Choose to learn the game at a slow forgiving pace, or skip ahead to the start of the action!						</project:description>

About This Game
							Concealed Intent is a simultaneous turn-based game of tactical space combat. Players control their ships in a fully 3D world - hunting down their enemies, just as they are being hunted themselves. In Concealed Intent you know your enemies are out there, but not exactly where, or even what they are.
 To defeat your enemies you need to devise a range of strategies to gain enough information to successfully shoot at them. All the while they are trying to do the same to you.
   Space is big and empty. Finding something can be like looking for a needle in a haystack, but there is nowhere for the needle to hide. To stay concealed a ship needs to fade into the background as much as possible. Everything a ship does will signal its presence and increase the ability of those nearby to detect it. A big ship may blot out stars as it passes. Heat from engines can be detected against the cold of the void. Lasers can be traced back to their origin. Eventually as detection increases, a firing solution can be calculated so that a beam of coherent light a few millimeters in diameter can cross thousands of kilometers to strike an evasive enemy - hidden no longer!Key Features  Turn-based - play at your own pace
Single player campaign, instant skirmishes, &amp; online play
Numerous ship types with configurable offensive and defensive ship components
Rewatch turns
User editable colors - colorblind friendly

About This Game
Dungeon Generation
With procedurally generated dungeons, you’ll never know what’s in the next room! Maybe a dozen traps? Maybe an army of angry Skullfaces? Whatever it is, you must save the prisoners and return peace to the Floating Islands.Multiplayer
You are not alone - just plug in any major controller and get playing! In Questria, up to 16 people can play at once!
It will be much easier with your pals, unless you enable friendly fire for extra challenge! Each encounter will become a careful ballet of carnage!
Don’t have friends nearby? Computer controlled allies will help!Friendship
Questria is designed for multiplayer. Players can only use their special abilities so often, unless their allies cheer them on! Cheering is just the press of a button with no penalty. Sounds easy, but the Skullfaces will make sure you don’t get the chance!						</project:description>

About This Game
							Defend the Highlands combines the genres of Tower Defence, Real Time Strategy, and Scotland. The player will have to build defences, recruit Scotsmen and manage their porridge stockpile as they fight off the English invasion of Scotland.
 The player will control a band of Scotsmen, led by the short, hairy and nationalistic pub owner Alfredo. Making use of traditional Scottish weaponry, such as golf clubs and haggis catapults, the band of Scotsmen must defend locations around Scotland, Wales and England, as they defend their homeland, and then take the fight to the enemy.
 Fight wacky enemies: Welshmen who ride sheep into battle, English teapot hurlers, Irish potato farmers, and many more.
Build crazy defensive structures including porridge cannons, turnip turrets and cheese wheel stations.
Building defenses is only half the equation. Unlike ordinary tower defense games, you will also have to man your towers with Scotsmen.
Recruit Scotsmen to your cause by playing bagpipes - but be sure to keep your bagpipe players defended.
Capture and hold oat farms to keep your porridge stockpile full.
Command powerful hero characters, from the humble pub owner Alfredo, to the great William Wallace himself.
Earn points and upgrade your Scotsmen and defensive structures.
Fight the enemy through a 20 level story mode, or play custom matches in skirmish mode. </project:description>

About This Game
							The world has been overrun by Orcs, the few humans who survived the great Orc uprising have fled their homes. Towns and castles have been left abandoned, the world is at the mercy of the ferocious invading armies. Stubborn and determined you refused to run or die, hiding in the thick forest near your home plotting your revenge has led to the creation of a weapon to rival any sword, counter any magic and pierce damn near anything with lethal force. It is now up to you alone, armed with your revolutionary new weapon, to enact revenge against the hordes and cleanse your lands of their stench.
 The Crossbow! – Drum fed with an infinite supply of bolts this is the only weapon any Orc Slayer really needs! Combine that with the powerful, magical special bolts dotted around the world and you’ve got a weapon fit to take on any army of unruly Orcs! Earn experience from your slaying and use it to upgrade your crossbow and special bolts for maximum Orc Slaying!
 The Orcs! – Near brainless, angry and motivated by only one thing; killing anything that isn’t an Orc. Several different types of Orc and their minions make up the invasion force, each requiring a different approach to deal with, each with their own unique menace. Hit them with everything you’ve got!
 The World! – Travel across the land through towns, valleys, castles and swamps! Leaving no stone unturned in your pursuit of total Orc annihilation. Careful though, they are easier out in the open in broad daylight than they are in the dark, damp corridors of a castle. Or thick foliage of a swamp.						</project:description>

About This Game
							Mushihimesama (“Bug Princess” in English) is a vertical shooting game set in a beautiful fantasy world.  Huge insect-like creatures called Koju roam the forest outside the village of Hoshifuri.  When Reco&apos;s people fall to a mysterious sickness, the young princess decides to leave the village and meet the God of the Koju, who may provide a cure.  Riding her faithful Golden Beetle friend Kiniro, Reco must traverse the wilds, braving the hostile landscape and the aggressive Koju beasts on her journey through the Shinju Forest.
   Main Features:  Explore a beautiful fantasy world rendered in stunning HD sprite graphics.  Battle a variety of giant &quot;Koju&quot; bugs across 5 stages, including a blazing desert, lush forests, and a serene cave.  CAVE&apos;s trademark bullets create a stunning visual impression, with iconic patterns unfolding in every boss encounter!
 Play the definitive shooter from the legendary developers that pioneered the &quot;bullet hell&quot; genre!  By decreasing the size of the player hitbox, Mushihimesama is able to challenge the player with some of the most intriguing and innovative shot patterns in the shoot &apos;em up genre.  Experience the thrill of dodging thousands of bullets at once in one of CAVE&apos;s best games!
 Choose from several game modes:  Arcade mode is designed to be as close to the original arcade game as possible.  Novice mode is similar to Arcade, but balanced for new players.  Arrange is a remixed version where you start with maximum firepower and defend yourself automatically.  Customize further with 3 different weapon types and two different option types.
 Mushihimesama has several different modes and difficulty settings, including a mode specifically balanced for new players.  No matter your skill level, you are certain to find a favorite mode!  Bold players should try the notorious &quot;Ultra&quot; mode, which is infamous for being one of the most difficult challenges in gaming!
 Mushihimesama V1.5 &quot;Matsuri&quot; Mode is available separately as optional DLC.  V1.5 is a remixed game mode with alternate music and mechanics.  Crank up the multiplier by firing close to enemies, but beware, as the bullet speed will also increase!  Previously, this mode was only available on an extremely limited basis, but now it is available to every player on Steam!
 Enjoy energetic and inspiring music from composers Manabu Namiki and Masaharu Iwata.  There are two soundtracks included (three with V1.5) to create an unforgettable mood for each stage.  You can choose which soundtrack to play for every stage and area, so feel free to mix and match your favorite tracks!   A robust list of optional features are supported, including:  A training mode to assist with practicing individual stages.
Multiple options to adjust viewing windows, screen size and position, and screen orientation.  Try the vertical &quot;tate&quot; mode to get an arcade-authentic picture!
An assortment of beautiful background images.
Support for keyboard customization and multiple controllers.
Online global leaderboards with replay sharing.
Local co-op gameplay.

About This Game
							Football Manager is the most realistic, in-depth and immersive football management simulation available – it’s the closest thing to doing the job for real. Taking control of any squad from more than 50 countries across the world, you decide who plays and who sits on the bench, deal with the media and solve player problems. You&apos;re in total control of tactics, team-talks, substitutions and pitch-side instructions as you follow the match live with the acclaimed 3D match engine.
 New Game Modes  Create A Club Add your own club to the game using the &apos;Create-A-Club&apos; option. Name your club, choose your colours and edit your squad to your heart’s content – even adding yourself and a friend.
 Fantasy Draft Create your dream team and take on your mates in ‘Fantasy Draft’ mode. Starting with a fixed budget, each manager builds a squad from scratch, competing with other managers to sign the best talent before going head-to-head against one another in a mini-league.
 Manager on the Touchline Get closer to the action than ever before with your own customisable character to bark out instructions and join the celebrations from the touchline.
 Improved Matchday Experience More than 2,000 new animations, alongside lots of other graphical improvements and improved AI, make the Football Manager 2016 match view the best ever.
 Multi Match Highlights A highlights package available to easily view other fixtures in your own competition (or others) to keep you up-to-date with everything that’s going on in the world around you.
 Prozone Match Analysis Sports Interactive’s partnership with the leading sports statistics provider, Prozone, has seen a wide reaching revamp of the in-game match analysis tool, adding lots of useful functionality whilst also making it a lot more prominent and easier to use.
 Set Piece Creator Football Manager 2016’s powerful, yet easy-to-use set piece creator allows managers to set up multiple set piece routines to be used across multiple tactics; with different set pieces for each set piece taker, new zonal marking options and much, much more.
 More Realistic Injuries Sports Interactive has worked alongside a number of physiotherapists, doctors and related organisations to ensure that the depiction and treatment of injuries in Football Manager 2016 is more realistic than ever before. This doesn’t mean that fewer injuries will be sustained, but that those which do occur will be treated and develop more realistically. Injuries will now be determined during matches, while new injury types have been added and there is now a tangible distinction between player condition and match sharpness.
 Expanded Press Interaction Press conferences are more varied than ever before, with many new conversations to be had with the press, especially more contextual questions &amp; responses. In addition, unemployed managers can now use media interviews to help get them back into the game.
 Stats, Stats, Stats Managers now have access to more detailed statistical information than ever before, with the introduction of a revamped stats screen and an all-new rolling stats panel.
 New and Improved Screens Information is now easier to find as a result of a revamp to many of the main screens, including player overview, tactics, the manager’s home screen and the transfer offer screen.
 And Much, Much More Further additions and updates include staff shortlisting, improved manager and staff movement, revised board requests, a revamp of board confidence, more contextual team talks, fully updated competition rules &amp; squad information, an improved financial module, improved AI transfers and team selection, new social media features and many more – all of which combine to make Football Manager 2016 the most complete and immersive simulation of football management ever.Football Manager Touch

About This Game
							Jurassic Island: The Dinosaur Zoo

Come and build your own dinosaur world with this unique Jurassic Island Zoo game! Operate a successful dinosaur park by attracting many visitors. Join the community and build your own creation! 

It takes only 2 minutes to build a Zoo: http://youtu.be/NKEDTb0mOV8

Create your own unique tour with different stations so visitors can observe the dinosaurs. The more likes you collect the more funds you accumulate (a heads up: locating the dinosaurs drinking and feeding bowls close to the stations is key). With your extra earned cash, expand the park with further services and amenities for visitors, such as gift shops, hotels, restaurants, while you are also in charge of securing food and water supplies, electricity and a necessary security system. A volcano nearby and unpredictable weather are additional challenges to manage your park successfully. 

And don’t forget: dinosaurs can escape and chase visitors! So make sure to build safe heavens and provide swift assistance and evacuation for the visitors to safely operate your park. 

Of course the happiness and well-being of the dinosaurs are of equal importance. Build them comfortable, clean enclosures with many plants, rocks, and lots of food and drinking spots. No visitor wants to see a sick dinosaur! Did a Dino escape? No worries, you will have a variety of tools at your disposal to catch them and to restore the operation of your park.  

Key features:
● authentic simulation and endless arrangements, 
● 9 different type of meat and plant-eating dinosaurs,
● 15 different buildings,
● unrestricted construction of road and animal enclosures,
● a variety of challenges and scenarios, 
● share the favorite pictures of your park with your friends,
● excellent sound-effects and 3D animation

About This Game
							Signal to Noise is a music-driven action game. Taking inspiration from some of the greatest classic games, it’s a high-octane rail shooter that builds itself in front of your eyes from any music you play.

Analyzing more audio components than any music-driven game before, Signal to Noise pieces together your experience based on the dynamics, pitch and tempo of your chosen track, interpreting it phrase-by-phrase and crafting your experience on the fly. Enemies, power-ups and the arenas themselves are different each time you play a new tune. The game supports any audio file or playlist, and can even be played at live music events.

Welcome to the next generation of music-driven gaming.						</project:description>

About This Content
							Lizardmen race comes with its own unique AI and players (skinks, Saurus and Kroxigor) but also their own star players: Slibli  and Hemlock!

The biggest strength of the Lizardmen lies in two types of key players available: Skinks and Saurus. Skinks are very fast and nimble. Bringing the ball to the goal line is not a problem for them. While very mobile, Saurus are also amazingly powerful. Their role is to breach the enemy&apos;s defense line so that Skinks can sneak through with the ball. The Kroxigor is a true mountain of muscle and scales. He adds an important strike force to his team. He is rather fast for his size, which allows him to act quickly. Unfortunately, he sadly lacks in dexterity. The Kroxigor is the player to use when Lizardmen want to hit hard...						</project:description>

About This Game
 The change of demographics caused aging of population. The government belatedly announced a new measure to stimulate birth rate, however the elderly already outnumbered the young. With severe labor shortage, the government came up with a policy to immigrate the foreign workers. Soon the foreign labor force became the backbone of the nation’s infrastructure and formed mixed-race families among themselves. As the economy thrives, the racial intolerance and bigotry grow rapidly. Ethnic chauvinism of Nation’s “pure-blooded” and racism deepened, and the anger towards them soon grew to violence. 
 Now, a total war has begun between the CT-FORCE, who desires stability and maintenance of the status quo and the Free Rebel, who tries to attain their needs by force.

About This Content
							WOOD ELVES race comes with its own unique AI and players (Passers, Wardancers, catchers, linemen and the Treeman) but also their own star players: Dolfar Longstride and Jordell Freshbreeze!

Elves are amazingly agile and almost as fast as Skaven. Avoiding other&apos;s tackles is a pure formality for them. Especially for the Wardancers whose ability to go through opposing defenses is nearly outmatched. Elves are excellent passers and catchers. Their game could become a true nightmare for other teams not as agile and fast as they are.
The Treeman is probably the strongest player in the whole of Blood Bowl. He&apos;s gifted with an extraordinary natural strength against which very few players can compete. However, the Treeman is extremely slow and has a bad tendency of taking root in the middle of the field. If that happens, he won&apos;t be able to move...at all.						</project:description>

About This Game
Angels That Kill is a dark, first person adventure game. It tells the story of two men as they uncover the truth behind a murder that has shaken the city. Play through both sides of the story and discover the truth behind the murder.
Play as Micheal Bickel, a Vietnam War veteran that now works as a Noll City detective, and play as James Baley, a drunk and drug-ridden retired boxer who has lost everything and moved to Noll City to start again. Go through the different days playing as both characters and work around the case, interact with the population and make decisions that could affect a number of people. Hide, run, investigate, explore, and discover while becoming a part in Noll City in this tragic time.
  Play both sides of the story. Go through both the suspects and the investigators story, to discover the truth and interact with the people of Noll City. Play through two different perspectives and have unique interactions based off of who you play as.
 Stay alive under a steel sky. Keep a watch on and maintain your hunger level by scavenging through dumpsters to stay alive in this deserted time. Every scrap of food you take for one character is another lost for the other, so make sure you balance your portions carefully.
 Explore all your options. Just because there is a story doesn&apos;t mean that you cant help make it, choose between right and wrong, make decisions you didn&apos;t mean to, and discover your own ending.

About This Game
							Easy to play, difficult to master, UmiharaKawase  is a totally unique ‘Rubbering Action’ physics based puzzle platform game with over 20 years of gaming history.
 Developed by the creators of the original game (Kiyoshi Sakai and Toshinobu Kondo) and available for the first time really globally, this cult classic was a Japanese indie smash hit before the rest of the world knew what a cult classic was!
 `Umihara Kawase` - a  backpacking Japanese sushi chef armed with a fishing rod, a rubber fishing line and a fishing hook. Avoid fish-like enemies, conveyer belts, spikes, watery pits, time travel and more. The deeper in to this dream-like game players venture, the more challenging the solutions and the greater the time pressure becomes.  Along the way, look out for shortcuts and secret exits and unlock bonus levels.
 It is the elasticity of Kawase-chan’s rubber fishing line that has set this apart from all other rope games, giving unprecedented levels of mobility and discovery. Tightening the line or giving lots of slack can be the difference between success and failure. The bungee like nature of the fishing line allows the player to stretch down to otherwise unreachable areas or be catapulted upwards.Key Features The latest version of this classic 20-year old franchise
 ‘UmiharaKawase’ game - this was the first game in the franchise, released in 1994 for console
Created by programmer Kiyoshi Sakai (also programmer on ‘The Mosquito’) and character designer &amp; illustrator, Toshinobu Kondo – creators of the original game.

About This Game
In the darkest corners of the Caribbean, an old evil is rising again.  It&apos;s been years since Christopher Raven&apos;s family was brutally murdered by Neville “the Devil” Scranton and his bloodthirsty gang, the Devil&apos;s Tines. Orphaned and missing a hand, Christopher is rescued by Marcus, an ex-slave and rum-maker who nurses Christopher back to health and takes him under his wing.
 Growing up with a black bitterness in his heart, Christopher drowns his demons in rum and violence, brooding endlessly on the revenge that was stolen from him when the Devil’s Tines disappeared in the monstrous quake that sunk half of Port Royal. When a string of brutal and all too familiar murders occur, Christopher’s chance for revenge is suddenly within his grasp. Neville and the Tines are back, and nothing on earth will stop Christopher from claiming their heads.CONTENT OF THE DIGITAL DELUXE EDITION A brand new location waiting to be explored, with additional 60 minutes of playing time

About This Game
 Rise: Battle Lines is a quick and accessible multiplayer-focused battle game that delivers meaty strategy in a bite-size format! Draft an army and fight a battle all in 15 thrilling minutes. Opponents issue orders at the same time in this unique system of simultaneous turn-based tactics. The rules are simple but the strategies require the brains, bravery and sheer bravado of a general, destined to Rise!    Simultaneous Turn-Based Combat - Both players take their turns at the same time, issuing an order to each of their units. Orders play out simultaneously so try to
predict your opponent&apos;s next move, conceal your true intentions and expect the unexpected!
 Draft Your Own Army - Opponents start by placing units into their army from a randomized selection of the 6 different unit types making every battle different. Each unit you pick is one your opponent cannot use, so choose wisely!
 Many Ways to Play - Learn against our AI characters, get matched with a similarly skilled stranger in a timed game or challenge a Steam friend and play live or asynchronously using Steam notifications.
 Customize Your Coat of Arms - Fight battles to earn Glory, which unlocks new titles and designs for your heraldry.
 Stats &amp; Leaderboards - Stats are tracked so you can analyze your play and your Glory is listed in global and friends-only leaderboards.
 Original Soundtrack - Dynamic score of soaring fantasy refrains, thumping war songs and wistful melodies from acclaimed composer Murugan Thiruchelvam.

        <project:description>
About This Content
  The All Legends Pack gets you immediate access to all current legends (85$ worth) and every legend we add in the future of Brawlhalla. Forever.    Brawlhalla: An eternal battle arena where the greatest warriors in history brawl to prove who&apos;s the best that ever was, is, or will be. Competitors from all eras slug it out in devious and challenging arenas. Every match is an epic test of skill, speed, and strength, and every victory brings additional glory and bragging rights to the winners. 
 Clockwork VALKRIs salt these slugfests with powerful weapons and gadgets. Fighters scramble to grab swords, axes, hammers, blasters, rocket lances and more! Every weapon changes your play style and your options. Gadgets like mines, bombs, and spiked spheres add even more danger into the mix, letting fighters change the course of battle with a well timed-throw or carefully laid trap. 
 Brawlhalla is a free to play, 2D platform fighting game featuring both online and local singleplayer/ co-op modes. When the final version launches it will include: 
Online Team Brawl - The most popular format, two teams of up to four warriors face off in a frenetic, no holds barred brawl. 
Online Ranked 1v1 - A personal test of skill where you match up against a single opponent to claim untold levels of personal glory in Brawlhalla. 
Online Ranked 2v2 - Bolster your ranks with a friend to prove your mettle, wit and teamwork in frenetic 2v2 battles. 
4 Player Online Free for All - Ranked or casual matches where four fighters enter, but only one can win. 
8 Player 4v4 &amp; FFA - Because the only thing better than four legends vying for bragging rights is eight legends battling for bragging rights. 
Local Free for All - Up to 4 players can play in free for all mode on one computer - perfect for friendly face-offs. 
Local Custom Teams - Team-up on your local machine, by adding up to 4 bots into the mix for living-room level mayhem.
Alternate Game Modes - Brawlball, Bombsketball and more provide ‘casual’ ‘party game’ ‘just for fun’ alternate game modes with completely different objectives and just as much competition. Early Access Available now for free!  Brawlhalla will always be 100% free to play, with no pay-to-win advantages and no in-game purchases to keep you from the action. In Open Beta there are a few things that we’ll be continuing to improve on, and a few things you’ll have special access to as a player who joins us in Open Beta.						</project:description>

About This Content
							Mushihimesama V1.5, also known as &quot;Matsuri&quot; mode, is an alternate game mode for Mushihimesama with remixed content and new game mechanics.  
 There are a number of differences compared to the original game:
 The stages have an alternate, more saturated color palette.
An awesome remixed soundtrack exclusive to this mode.
Enemies are positioned in new locations and fire somewhat different shot patterns.  Some strategies will need to be re-learned.
You can collect amber from the ground by holding the focus shot button.
You begin with two options equipped. You can also activate MAX mode by selecting full power weapons in the weapon selection screen.  There are a number of additional changes specific to MAX mode:
 You begin with a fully powered weapon right at the start of the game, but at the cost of increased difficulty and bullet speed.
Collecting amber chips increases your counter.  You can generate large amber by shooting enemies at point blank range to increase the counter faster.
Bullets are much faster when the counter is over 10,000 or 50,000, but you will get increased points.
You begin with only one bomb, but with the MAX mode enabled Reco will defend herself automatically if hit.  MAX mode encourages a very aggressive play style right from the start of the game and presents a different challenge for veteran players to enjoy.						</project:description>

About This Game
							The year is 1910. Bathed in pale Spring sunlight, the small fishing port of Illsmouth is a sleepy New England town where time seems to stand still. Appearances can be very deceiving, however .... Beneath the peaceful tranquility of this small village, a horrifying truth lingers.
 Whispers in a dusty, secluded library ripple with fear as questions of the past are brought into the present. Is there a link between the return of Halley&apos;s comet and the resurgence of the Great Ancients who once dominated the land in a reign of terror? Legend tells tales of an ancient ritual ground, hidden deep in the shadows of the tangled forest, marked by an ornate and mysterious cross. Once, long ago, this site was the stage for wild and terrifying rites that no one dare speak of, lest they suffer the wrath of the Ancients.
 Why are the townspeople of Illsmouth struck by such shattering terror? Why are they drawn to the ancient ritual grounds after so many years? What has released this curse from its deep sleep to play havoc upon the souls of innocent people?
 You&apos;ll take on the role of John T. Carter, a brilliant young astronomer, piecing together the puzzling history of the village and its cryptic inhabitants. Incredibly realistic action and supernatural chaos intertwine to draw players deep into the puzzling mysteries within the Shadow of the Comet.
 Includes the CD-ROM and floppy versions of Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet.
Bone chilling sound effects that hurtle you into the depths of chaos!
Confront your deepest fears as you enter once more the realm of Lovecraftian horror! </project:description>

Each mode includes several sets of applicable tactics and derivative skills, bringing the endless and changeable battlefield experience.
   Highly immersive interactive map to restore World War II scenarios.  The development team of Steel Ocean accurately simulates the isles, reefs, buildings, metrological, weather conditions, etc. of many sea areas in the world, based on the results of consulting extensive historic records and many times of site surveys, and the actual geographic environment data. 
  Separated Damage Calculation system to ensure more accurate attack.  In addition to the original damage calculation by health bars of the TPS vehicle war games, Steel Ocean is incorporated with the separated damage calculation system (“SDC”). 
  Commanded by hundreds of officers of World War II, providing warships with tactic soul.  Steel Ocean includes the innovative warship commander system, incorporated with hundreds of famous navy generals during the 2nd World War, based on the actual history of the period, to impart the cold warships with the different tactic features. 
  Unique legion system to create super marine legions.  The fleet guild system provides a big platform for players to communicate on tactics, and also combines the team play and the fleet growth mechanism into one. 
  Built-in radio voice to effectively restore maritime communication.  One of the most critical factors deciding the success or failure of a military operation is intelligence. The information communication at any place and at any time is the basis for the battle with the team collaboration, and the key for realizing the strategic cooperation of multiple warship types in the modern sea battles. </project:description>

About This Game
							Evolution is a real time simulation of the evolutionary process. Creatures have DNA that defines their structure, traits, how they see the world around them, and how they react to it. Each creature is unique, most die quickly, some die a little slower, and others survive (some just like rocks, they usually die too). It is the survivors that reproduce and mutate, just a little, but enough to adapt to their environment. Early creatures are pretty basic but they have the capacity for some pretty elaborate behaviors and, to be honest, I am not sure how interesting this could get. 

There are a number of games built around this evolution simulator. Primordial Soup is a free for all evolution platform where the creatures evolve mostly independently.  You can help them along but its their world and they do what they like.  To start you choose a world (or create a new one) and all the creatures become part of a global shared pool.  It quickly becomes apparent that older more evolved creatures will dominate but there is always a chance you could evolve one that survives. Alternatively you can just start a new world and become the dominant creature there.  

In Tidepool, the world is stacked in your favor to help you select and breed the creatures you deem fit to live. At first you control a small handful of creatures and help them find food, focus on those that move independently, or just let them figure it out. You compete against creatures that evolved in other tide pools from other players so it is never the same game twice. If you do manage to take over the environment all your creatures level up and you start over competing against the next level of enemy creatures. 

The laboratory is where you can experiment on your creatures, cross breed creatures with other creatures, manage, save and share your creatures, and apply targeted mutations.  Unfortunately the laboratory was not secure enough and the inevitable outbreak occurred.  In this micro battle to stop the spread of an unstoppable pathogen (that you foolishly created) you battle the creatures directly in a miniaturized ship.   Save Patient Zero to save the world, unless the creatures manage to find their way into another human but what are the odds of that happening?						</project:description>

About This Game
							A minimal, atmospheric space survival &amp; exploration game, set to deep ambient music.

Pilot the last vessel of a fallen civilization into the vast unknown, in search of a new habitable world.

Carefully land on the planets you will encounter to gather terraforming resources and space-faring human survivors for the final destination... skillful piloting and the balanced management of fuel, oxygen &amp; hull integrity are key.

Explore and harvest to create a beautiful and harmonious new world, but take too much and you might incur the wrath of sentient alien life...						</project:description>

About This Game
							Bad news! The lawyer Kathleen Wilson has discovered that her beloved Danny Reed has been arrested under strange circumstances. He’s being accused of murder. In order to free Danny, she’s going to have to carry out her own investigation.

Kathleen has to find out the truth of what really happened. Was he set up, or was it just some kind of misunderstanding? Is there something bigger behind all this? Right now, nothing is clear...

Collect photographs, notes, slides – anything that might be useful in your investigation. Record all the facts and clues in your notebook - they could come in handy later. It isn’t hard to hit a dead end in an investigation, but don’t panic - you can use a hint.						</project:description>

About This Game
Vinty is attending a calligraphy event over in Melbourne. At last, she will be able to meet Excelia, the world famous calligrapher. Determined to study and mimic her idol&apos;s every move, will Vinty end up losing her identity?  Vinty is back in this sequel to Without Within! WOWI2 is roughly 20,000 words long, which is about five times the length of the original. Throughout the read, players will find links to YouTube videos that feature various footage of Melbourne (currently blocked by Steam on Linux versions, which I apologize for). Hopefully players will like these optional videos as much as I enjoyed filming them. Last, rather than putting in contrived choices like I did with the first game, WOWI2 is a linear story (kinetic novel). I hope to be able to tell a more focused tale this time around.
 Thank you everyone! I hope you will find the experience worthwhile.						</project:description>

About This Content
* Note: Each DLC pack may only be purchased and activated once per Gladiators Online account. Previous ownership of items additionally contained in the DLC package does not constitute a valid reason for refund or compensation, so please check them carefully prior to purchase.Gladiators Online - Tiro Pack
From Latin tiro ‎(“a novice gladiator or young soldier”). This pack contains the basic elements needed to put you onto a sound economic footing early on in Gladiators Online.
Package Contents:  Fully equiped level 3 Premium Gladiator (random class)
The main benefit of a premium gladiator is his free replacement (as purchased) upon death. This means you will not need to either invest or start from the bottom, saving precious time and silver. Additionally, premium gladiators earn more experience while levelling quicker, gaining more fans opposed to standard gladiators - thus improving the level of your “House”, unlocking new content with it. Lastly, premium gladiators have a higher “Potential” rating, allowing them to reroll attribute gains several times in a row - if you have collected enough reroll tokens, that is...
10,000 Silver Denari
The main currency of the game. Silver Denarii (correctly spelled with two i in Latin) are by no means easy to come by, and you should not expect to be showered with free silver during play. A bag of Denari will help you buy all relevant items as well as the potentially life saving combat consumables, not to mention the staff required for training and recuperating your champions.    
500 Gold Aurei
Rare and valuable currency distributed only sparingly throughout the game. Not required to play or enjoy Gladiators Online, yet allowing purchase of masterfully crafted items and exceptionally skilled staff. The majority of these goods are permanent, aiding the player with time and silver saving benefits without unbalancing the game and combat.  
10 Reroll Tokens
Reroll tokens are scarce collectable items granting the opportunity to utilize the gladiator’s “Potential”. Each token allows you to reroll an otherwise final result when assigning a trained attribute point to your gladiator’s preferred attribute category, thus allowing you to further form and specify his strengths. These tokens represent all the extra coaching hours and one-to-one lessons reserved only for the most promising talent in the ludus.

From Latin rudis ‎(“wooden sword awarded to veteran gladiators upon gaining their freedom”). The Rudiarius Pack caters to the advancing player who wants to immediately fight in a larger arena, thus earning more silver faster. Your fighters will additionally benefit from the increased regeneration times provided by the medical staff included in this purchase. 
Package Contents:  Fully equiped level 5 Premium Gladiator (random class)
The main benefit of a premium gladiator is his free replacement (as purchased) upon death. This means you will not need to either invest or start from the bottom, saving precious time and silver.

Lastly, premium gladiators have a higher “Potential” rating, allowing them to reroll attribute gains several times in a row - if you have collected enough reroll tokens, that is...
Curer, a level 5 Premium Healer “I swear by Apollo the Physician, and Asclepius the Surgeon that, according to my ability and judgement, I will apply measures for the benefit of the sick according to the best of my ability”. Acquiring a premium and thus permanent medic should greatly reduce the time associated with healing, specifically for gladiators below and up to the healer’s own level.     
Strumpet, a level 5 Premium Courtesan “As long as you hold off from brides, single women, maidens, the youth and free boys, love whatever you want.” Victory is a fickle mistress and more oft than not it takes a woman’s embrace to restore a defeated gladiator’s failing morale. Purchasing a permanent courtesan for your ludus will aid the speedy recovery of any demoralized man, specifically for fighters below and up to the courtesan’s own level.  
15,000 Silver Denari
The main currency of the game. Silver Denarii (correctly spelled with two i in Latin) are by no means easy to come by, and you should not expect to be showered with free silver during play. A bag of Denari will help you buy all relevant items as well as the potentially life saving combat consumables, not to mention the staff required for training and recuperating your champions.

Each token allows you to reroll an otherwise final result when assigning a trained attribute point to your gladiator’s preferred attribute category, thus allowing you to further form and specify his strengths. These tokens represent all the extra coaching hours and one-to-one lessons reserved only for the most promising talent in the ludus.

About This Content
* Note: Each DLC pack may only be purchased and activated once per Gladiators Online account. Previous ownership of items additionally contained in the DLC package does not constitute a valid reason for refund or compensation, so please check them carefully prior to purchase.Gladiators Online - Lanista Pack
From Latin lanista‎ (“manager of a team of gladiators”). This offer leaves no desires unfulfilled to the aspiring gladiator owner. From selected sanatorium staff, providing quick recovery, to the veteran Doctore, instructing your men in fitness and combat skills, this pack is brimful of value. 
Package Contents:  Fully equiped level 7 Premium Gladiator (random class)
The main benefit of a premium gladiator is his free replacement (as purchased) upon death. This means you will not need to either invest or start from the bottom, saving precious time and silver. Additionally, premium gladiators earn more experience while levelling quicker, gaining more fans opposed to standard gladiators - thus improving the level of your “House”, unlocking new content with it. Lastly, premium gladiators have a higher “Potential” rating, allowing them to reroll attribute gains several times in a row - if you have collected enough reroll tokens, that is...
Surgeon, a level 7 Premium Healer “I swear by Apollo the Physician, and Asclepius the Surgeon that, according to my ability and judgement, I will apply measures for the benefit of the sick according to the best of my ability”. Acquiring a premium and thus permanent medic should greatly reduce the time associated with healing, specifically for gladiators below and up to the healer’s own level.     
Siren, a level 7 Premium Courtesan “As long as you hold off from brides, single women, maidens, the youth and free boys, love whatever you want.” Victory is a fickle mistress and more oft than not it takes a woman’s embrace to restore a defeated gladiator’s failing morale. Purchasing a permanent courtesan for your ludus will aid the speedy recovery of any demoralized man, specifically for fighters below and up to the courtesan’s own level.  
Co-Trainer, a level 7 Premium Doctore
Doctore (Latin “teacher”) is the title awarded to your coaches and trainers. These veteran gladiators drill your men hard, sometimes mercilessly. Through constant exercise your fighters will transform raw  attribute points gained in fights into attribute improvements such as damage or initiative.  
30,000 Silver Denari
The main currency of the game. Silver Denarii (correctly spelled with two i in Latin) are by no means easy to come by, and you should not expect to be showered with free silver during play. A bag of Denari will help you buy all relevant items as well as the potentially life saving combat consumables, not to mention the staff required for training and recuperating your champions.    
1,200 Gold Aurei
Rare and valuable currency distributed only sparingly throughout the game. Not required to play or enjoy Gladiators Online, yet allowing purchase of masterfully crafted items and exceptionally skilled staff. The majority of these goods are permanent, aiding the player with time and silver saving benefits without unbalancing the game and combat.

About This Game
 Tactical Soccer The New Season  is a turn-based soccer simulation. 
 Control all 11 players at the same time - instead of shouting at your left back to ‘get forward’ you control them and can build up an attack exactly how you want. You are the coach and have real control of the team.
 The gameplay is simple. When it&apos;s your turn, select a player and decide where they should move; or perhaps prepare them to head the ball. If they have the ball, you can pass, shoot or dribble. Once you&apos;ve instructed your players, press ‘end turn’ and watch them carry out your orders. The computer controlled team then plays. Play continues like this until the match ends.
  The game is played on a 3D pitch (not a tiled board), so you can move the camera to line up that perfect pass or watch as your speedy winger manages to just out run the opposition&apos;s tiring defender.
 Players have different abilities - speed, dribbling, tackling, passing, shooting, stamina etc. Use your tactical skills to maximise the strengths of your players to defeat the opposition. When defending, you have to be positionally aware and block the opposition&apos;s runs with your players.
 Tactical Soccer The New Season Features  Turn-based Strategy Soccer simulation focusing on the match 
The match takes place on a 3D pitch.
Includes fouls, offside, penalties and different formations.
Features Men’s and Women’s sides. 
Different team strips and looks.
Single exhibition match, Knockout cup and ‘endless’ league championship modes. 
In Exhibition mode, play against either the computer or another player (playing on the same PC).
League competitions (you can play as many seasons as you like) feature player development, contracts and transfers.
Coaches can shape the abilities of their players. 
About the developer
Back in 2002 I released Tactical Soccer on the Internet. Jump a decade or more and I thought it would be nice to update Tactical Soccer for the current generation of PCs hence the title Tactical Soccer - The New Season. So I got together with an artist friend and this is the result. It&apos;s virtually a total overhaul of the game plus I&apos;ve been able to add in several features to the game to make it easier and quicker for the player to get the team to carry out their tactics.						</project:description>

About This Game
							Summer break, a time to relax and have fun. But what&apos;s the difference between a good summer and a great summer? Spending money, of course! And what better way to earn some extra cash than a car wash? Unfortunately, the local branch of Ninja Car Washing Corp. is right across the street and they don’t appreciate the competition...
 Wash cars quickly to keep your customers happy and keep the money coming in. But beware! Those pesky ninja will do everything they can to run you out of business. You’ll need to use your wits, reflexes, and collection of basic car washing tools to defend against their attacks while keeping your customers happy.
 Learn to wield powerful items like the Garden Hose, Giant Sponge, and Reptile Wax both to clean cars and fend off the attacking ninja! You’ll start by defending against simple threats like muddy water balloons and exploding shuriken, but prove yourself superior to such petty tricks and your reputation will grow, earning you more customers and more attention from your enemies. Use the money earned to upgrade your stand and buy new gear such as the Polishing Cloth, Textured Sponge, and Fire Hose then put that equipment to work, taking on bigger jobs and fighting off mud firing bazookas, ninja assassins, and the dreaded trained pigeon attack squad!
 Features: Action/Casual Gameplay
A hilarious story with hours of fun!
Three fast and furious arcade modes for endless replay value!
Over 25 different tools and upgrades for your car wash!
Over 20 different ninja to fight!
Choose to learn the game at a slow forgiving pace, or skip ahead to the start of the action!						</project:description>

About This Game
     2D classic retro-style gameplay
    RPG -- this isn&apos;t just shoot shoot shoot, you have to participate in the game&apos;s plot
    Is the largest game possible with the current version of GameMaker
    Science Fiction Post-Apocalyptic Space RPG!!
 It&apos;s the year 2600 AD, and you&apos;re recruited into the UFSE, a growing multi-species stellar federation that is just beginning to explore the galaxy near their homeworlds.  Space piracy has run rampant, and a strange disease is spreading between planets, possibly by a techno-religious cult named the Ursae Usa.  Powerful alien species and the run-of-the-mill riff-raff face down in the cold blackness of space.  
 You pilot the UFS Intrepid, an experimental craft pieced together by engineers working at Starbase One, Earth, Terran System.  Your crew is not all human: the UFSE is a diverse and growing stellar empire with several species recently allied.  Your job is to go out and explore the galaxy and bring back whatever artifacts you can find.  To fuel your vessel and build out its exofighters, your crew will spend time mining asteroids and exploring planetary bodies.  After a long day of work, you might treat them to a burger at Moburger, the local interstellar fast food franchise.
 In the current version of the game, you can experience combat and test out your ship.  Some of the highlights of this demo include: shooting enemy weapons off only to pick them up and install them!  Mine asteroids to build fighters which you can launch during combat!						</project:description>

        <project:description>
About This Game
							Hatters Gonna Hat edition is a downloadable version of the original web game, Zero Punctuation: Hatfall. Born out of the popular video series from The Escapist, ‘Zero Punctuation,’ Creator Ben ‘Yahtzee’ Croshaw developed a high-energy game of skill and, well, hat wearing. 

What’s New: The ‘Hatters Gonna Hat’ edition features brand new mini-games, new content and updates to all existing mini games so that it is fully optimized for PC. Also, if you reach 1500 hats collected... you&apos;ll see... something!

Haven’t played Hatfall yet? The premise seems simple- hats are falling from the sky (because, why not?) and it’s your job to catch them on your head - but mastering the fine art of hat catching isn’t nearly as simple as you might expect. Look out for anvils and refrigerators falling from the sky; the multitude of clones running around trying to confuse you; and that f**king short-tempered wizard. 

Your job is to master the art of putting on multiple hats and you must acquire them by ANY means necessary – catch them; steal them; embezzle them; seduce them if you must, just get the damn hats.						</project:description>

        <project:description>
About This Game
							Conquest of Elysium 4 is a quick turn based fantasy strategy game with a touch of rogue-like. The game might appear simple at first, but it is full of depth, details and of course monsters.

The main focus in CoE4 is that each race plays differently. We&apos;re not talking about a unique building and unique unit, we&apos;re talking about completely differently, with different mechanics and different goals. Perhaps you&apos;re playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you&apos;re a dwarf, who&apos;s only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 20 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium. 

New for the 4th version of Conquest of Elysium is the addition of different planes, many new rituals, monster descriptions, a completely new battle system, new random maps with varying temperatures and much more. 

The game has six different planes. There is for instance an Infernal plane that is the home of the devils and the demons. So if a demonologist manages to summon a demon lord, there will suddenly be a dark citadel without its master in inferno. Banishing a devil will now force it back to inferno instead of slaying it permanently. Although extremely difficult it is possible to permanently destroy a demon lord by storming inferno and slaying it on that plane. Although there are many planes now you will only rarely have to visit them. But they continue to run in the background and can make certain actions or random events more exciting.

Most factions start with a random set of rituals, a random set of combat spell and together with the random map that will ensure that no two games are the same. More rituals and spells can be learned during the game if you have the right resources and find the right locations. In addition to the aggressive wildlife of Elysium there&apos;s also random events to contend with, from bumper harvests and bandits, to the very gates of the underworld opening into Elysium. Your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy.						</project:description>

About This Game
Go Outside With Your Dog
  Lovely Weather We&apos;re Having is a goal-free explorer game. It uses local weather data to simulate the weather conditions where you are.
 You&apos;re locked out of your house in an odd, peaceful landscape with your trusty pooch. Interact with a dozen NPC&apos;s whose moods change with the weather. 
Jump off a roof. Kick a rock. Run through flowers. Be outside! 
 &quot;The vibrantly colored world of Lovely Weather We&apos;re Having doesn&apos;t take you back to a specific time necessarily, but to a mind set, when the world seemed bigger and brighter and more mystifying.&quot;
-Jess Joho, Kill Screen   &quot;Lovely Weather is a clever little mood stimulator on the contemplative end of the scale, a kind of dynamic Zen box. You open it and poke around a little and maybe close it, thinking “Is that all?”
And then you come back, and the weather’s different, and the time of day’s just so, and it takes your breath away.&quot;
-Matt Peckham, WIRED  &quot;it looks gentle and colourful and weathery which is rather appealing as I’ve had a nice morning of typing and listening to the rain fall outside.&quot;
-Philippa Warr, Rock Paper Shotgun  &quot;Watched the trailer and I have no idea what the game is about.&quot;
-Someone on reddit  SOME FEATURES: Responds to local weather data, simulates actually being outside.
Pleasant sounds, colors, and visuals that I hope you like. Designed with introverts in mind.
12 NPCs whose moods and conversation topics change with the weather and time of day.
Hundreds of conversations to be had (most of them not about the weather).
Open gameplay, forever.
Designed to be played in 10-20 minute bursts, endlessly.
Cute dog.
A top-secret c h e a t   c o d e.
Rocks you can kick. **SEE YOU OUTSIDE**						</project:description>

You are a nerdy bitard, who always stays at home. 
One day someone sends you a link to a weird website, going to which you are teleported to a mysterious island populated by several hostile fractions.

About This Content
							Eric Brooks&apos; mother was attacked by a vampire while giving birth, which would change Eric&apos;s fate forever. Becoming part man and part vampire, Eric retained many of the powers vampires possessed - including incredible speed, strength, and ability to sense other supernatural creatures - without suffering many of the weaknesses such as vulnerability to sunlight... but did not spare him the curse of bloodthirst. Referred to as the Daywalker by those he hunts, Eric Brooks swore vengeance against all vampires and became Blade - the vampire-slayer.Items Included in this Pack: Blade in default Undead Again Costume Blade Hero S.T.A.S.H.

About This Content
							Though the Imperial forces were victorious in the Second War for Armageddon, the planet is still a hotbed of activity and conflict.
 The surviving Orks that have not escaped off world left some of their spores to the Equatorial Jungle where they managed to survive and grow into a feral state, threatening the stability and rebuilding of Armageddon.
 To put a definitive end to this scourge a special force is assembled. Hardened by the fires of thousands of battles, these veterans will purge the equatorial jungles of this infestation, giving their lives for the greater glory of the God Emperor of Mankind: these are the Ork Hunters!
 To help these warriors in their mission, Inquisitor Horst - sent to Armageddon as one of the relief forces - will offer his support. The devastation wrought by the Second War is a breeding ground for corruption and could lead to something even more dangerous than the feral Orks!
 Ork Hunters is an expansion of Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon, set shortly after the end of the Second War of Armageddon, and it adds a new chapter to this epic saga!
 Follow the deeds of the Ork Hunters and the others elements of the Steel Legion in their effort to cleanse the Planet of every menace once and for all!
 This time reinforcements are not expected. No Space Marine forces remain on world in the immediate post war environment, and no Space Marine units will appear in this DLC campaign.  This will be a battle of only Imperial units, giving it a unique disposition compared to the main game!
 Four new Ork units make an appearance: Feral Wildboyz, Huntas, Boarboyz, and Junkas, alongside at least six new Ork hunter infantry types: Ork Hunter Company Command, Infantry, Flamers, Anti-Tank Support, Fire Support and Snipers.

History Zero Reflex is a little game project with minimalistic and clear design but with very addictive and frustrating gameplay. Do you have what it takes? Fun Fact: the initial code name of the project was The Reflexx 2. Due to similarities with many other published games the team decided to go with the name &quot;Eye Will Survive!&quot; which is a pun title inspired by the song &quot;I will survive&quot; by Gloria Gaynor, which after the soft launch was again renamed into Zero Reflex.						</project:description>

STORY A hundred years from now, Earth is a planet hostile to life. Atmospheric pollution, desertification, water scarcity, and overpopulation have ended human civilization. Due to technological advances, there are still small pockets of humanity left. Only with high tech suits can one walk the scorched surface of Earth.
But beware. The scavengers and the machines will hunt you down.

About This Game
							Sitting in front of a screen or TV you might think that the process behind filming and producing a movie is a piece of cake. Try and play Dream Factory first. With this Filming Simulator you will ‘dive’ headfirst into the busy world of movie making.
 Dream Factory is a PC (Win, Mac, Linux) and tablet (iOs, Android) based Simulator game. The movie making process doesn&apos;t always catch everyone’s attention because everyone likes watching the final result. But many of us really do like to know what lies behind the curtain, behind the stage…
 Our approach is to look at the industry in an ironic way. We’ve reviewed many different samples and cliches of both the old and modern Hollywood Industry, and rediscovered the most memorable names who made the filming culture of 20th-21st centuries what it is today.
 In Dream Factory you will have to create and organize the movie process, you will have to deal with greedy marketeers and tricky-chicky finance directors, while also having to put all your efforts to butter up capricious actors. On top of this you will have to learn how to build your studio and production company, brick by brick while, dealing with accounting problems and the like.
 But it won’t be a boring process, as we aim to take the humor and irony of the real world filming process and bring it into to our game. You can play the demo on our website &amp; give the games mechanics a go.
 Our story starts from at the very beginning, that is from brothers Lumiere&apos;s era and then continues through epoch by epoch to today and even beyond. That means Dream Factory will give you a glimpse into the future.
 In the final version of the game you will engage in the following tasks:
 Studio building process
Screenplay writing
Movie shooting process
Movie promotion by means of marketing campaign
Solve different complicated tasks and objectives
Level up your characters
Discover new movie genres
Track the needs of your characters
Act according to the cases prescribed in the contract for actresses and actors
Avoid waves of fans
Manage Actors who are affected by traumas and nervous breakdowns or manage situations where Actors have died while shooting a film
Receive awards and participate in exhibitions
Compete with your friends and attract their or other competitors actors to your own studio
Look up the reviews in press after the movie released and track what was done right and what was done wrong
Buy new territory to expand and grow your studio
 We plan to have 21 type of characters with at least 20 modifications to be drawn for each character to provide the game with more variation. All characters are hired via a HR market that is generated randomly during game play. Super-skilled characters (with high fame or status) may be found on the market alongside with unknown ones which you will have to train and grow yourself. Each type of character will posses his or her own modifiers (traits) that will influence certain game aspects. These traits are added to a character when they&apos;re born. Also during the process of filming, relationships between your staff may also come into being. These can be both positive and negative. For example, some relationships may influence other characters to leave the studio. We have already show some of the characters we plan to add below, but we plan to add more from the cinema industry, such as Audio Engineers, Movie Directors or Producers, Stage Movie Directors, Janitors, Managers, Handymen, Finance Directors, Marketeers, Costume and Makeup Artists, Extra Actors, Stunt Coordinators.						</project:description>

The program is mainly used by role players who would like to illustrate their player and non-player characters, but don&apos;t have the resources to create or buy many uniqe characters that fit their needs. The option to save the images as tokens or cards even reduces the work needs to be taken to use the pictures for real. 

Utilizing the program as an indie game developer unlocks the possibilities of endless character stream in our users products as well. They are often used for character portraits and to display visually appealing friend and enemy units. With very little effort, complete game scenes can be created. 

The generated images are a good source for writers to illustrate their characters, for artists, who compose them in completely unique environment, for designers to represent the characteristics of their ideas, just to mention a couple of good examples where the program is being used.

The program comes with 4 demo packages with limited content for free to start with. If you like the idea and find it useful, you can purchase addition packages later to match your needs.						</project:description>

Reviews
“The combat is exquisitely balanced. Yes, it relies on the generic trio of a tank to absorb enemy attacks, a healer to keep the tank standing, and two damage-dealers to take out the actual enemies. Yes, that’s a bit of an unexpected approach for a game that’s so old school in every other aspect. But it works so shockingly well, it’ll give you a brand new appreciation to the entire mechanic.”
4/5 – IndieGameReviewer  “By addressing most of the shortcomings found in old school 3D dungeon crawlers, Mana Games has created an addictive adventure game worth exploring.”
B+ – Defunct Games  “The Fall Of The Dungeon Guardians is a fantastic take on the First Person Dungeon Crawlers of old. [...] It&apos;s a wonderful blend of so many different things and it&apos;s presented beautifully.”
Let&apos;s Play – BumpyMcSquigums

About This Content
							The ESCHATOS Arranged Soundtrack presents a different interpretation of ESCHATOS music from composers Yousuke Yasui and Hiroto Saitoh. With more aggressive guitar and drum instrumentation, the ESCHATOS Arranged Soundtrack is more influenced by hard rock and metal music than the original version, but still retains the catchy hooks of the original chiptune-inspired compositions.

About This Game
							Brilliant Shadows is a visual novel that follows the story of Veronica Ashmar, a new graduate of the Mountain and a necromancer. Tradition dictates that upon graduation, necromancers and paladins are to perform the pairing ritual. Binding together one of each type of mage, entwining their lives and powers with another and sealing their fates together with a matching mark upon their primary hands.
 Those that succeed and become paired go on as full mages, those that do not are considered nothing more than hedge mages. There are no exceptions and the ritual has never failed…
 Until the day Ash receives a mark and no fellow graduate to match it.
 Now she must discover the origin of her mark and attempt to solve the greatest magical mystery that the Mountain has ever known.
   Brilliant Shadows – Part 1 of the Book of Gray Magic is 57,023 words long, estimated at 3-6 hours of game play depending on read speed.
 There are 3 different endings depending on your choices, as well as a few larger branch options within the story.
 Plus, the main character is a lesbian necromancer who specializes in undead plants!
 All spoken lines are fully voice acted, and the game features an extensive original soundtrack with 25 awesome songs.						</project:description>

“There&apos;s a healthy serving of challenging puzzles, a rarely-seen cultural setting to explore, and Professor Hunt remains one of the more likeable (if unlikely) protagonists in the genre today...”
Adventure Gamers  “The fourth installment’s story can also stand alone – the story’s core, the search for the mysterious game of Agon, is provided with a sophisticated and exciting background story, combining crime, a great deal of mystery and a delicate love story.”
Adventure-Archiv  “The puzzles in this game are challenging. Several of them are quite long and involved. The game encourages deductive reasoning by giving you clues that reward such thinking.”

About This Game
							THE GAME OF GALACTIC DOMINION

You are a Starlord. In command of a planet but hungry for real power. Your ultimate aim: to control the entire Galaxy and enable your family dynasty to rule forever. But one thousand other Starlords have similar ambitions!

At first, you&apos;ll concentrate on flying Starfighters and leading your forces in exciting 3-D battles. Then, you&apos;ll realize that the true path to success also involves diplomatic, planning and trading skills. Eventually, when you have secured your power base, you&apos;ll take your first steps up the feudal hierarchy. You must plan your strategy, weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of rivals, form favourable alliances then strike with all your might!

Success will extend the reach of your power across the Galaxy, allowing new treaties; generating new wealth. You can then install clan members on new planets under your control and summon vassal Lords to add their forces to your crusades of conquest. But beware, as your power increases, so does the price the others put on your head!
Plan, negotiate, Trade and Battle for Supreme Galactic Power!						</project:description>

About This Game
							The beauty of this armored warfare simulation is that it can be played from the simplest action mode to the most complex operational level of company command. You may choose to command only your particular tank or as many as 20 tanks, artillery and aircraft, while the battle rages around you with up to 40 total vehicles on the battlefield. Train at the army&apos;s tank school at Fort Knox before being called to battle in Central Europe or the Middle East.
 Multiple views from inside the tank, the authentic weapons systems and instrumentation, plus the spectacular graphics and rolling terrain combine to provide realism at its best. The fifteen challenging missions will satisfy even the most avid tankers. Call for reconnaissance planes and ground support when you encounter perilous situations as the Soviets send their best T-80 tanks, artillery and Frogfoot aircraft to halt your offensive. It&apos;s a fight to the finish. To the victor go the spoils!
  Control up to 16 (not just 4 tanks)
Head-to-head option
Command at the company, platoon, or individual tank level (commander, gunner, driver)
Three theaters of action (Fort Knox, Central Europe or the Middle East)
15 different missions
Reconnaisance, out-of-tank, and four different crew perspective views
Easy-to-learn action mode
Incredibly realistic rolling terrain and outstanding 3-D solid modelling graphics
Topographical battlefield map for strategic planning with 16 levels of zoom
Authentic weapons systems
Real-time action
Night mode with thermal imaging
Extremely large battlefield area (3 maps each containing over 600,000 acres)

About This Content
							An arms race is taking place in Gemini. The three largest factions are racing to develop true weapons of mass destruction, the massive Titan class vessels. The democratic Korkyra is producing a titan class vessel that is based on the latest shield technology and will feature the strongest shields ever seen in the Gemini universe. Baeldor baronies are united together in an effort to quickly produce a space behemoth that can land a strong punch. The Nyxian consortium used its informants and monetary wealth wisely and is able to quickly join the race by taking what is not theirs: a titan class sized vessel based on Imperial Leviathan designs.
 Join one of the factions in their worthy attempt and become the deciding factor. 
 Welcome to project Titan.
 ---
 Starpoint Gemini: Titans is an addition to the existing stories where players will be able to pick up where they stopped and simply continue on playing. Titans will give you a small taste of what Starpoint Gemini: Warlords, our next big project, is trying to achieve.						</project:description>

        <project:description>
About This Content
							This scenario pack takes the classic scenarios from Flashpoint Germany (2005) and brings them up to the vastly updated standard of the Flashpoint Campaigns game engine of 2015. This is the work of Charles (“Hawkeye”) Belva, a long-time member of the Flashpoint team and a beta tester for the original FPG game.
 Included are 17 scenarios with 43 variations along with the original four maps completely redone to new graphical standards.  The maps now feature hexes instead of the original grid and are the work of William van der Sterren who did the FPRS maps from build 2.0.6 onwards.
 In addition to the original four maps is a new map “Eiterberg” which is jumbo sized (40 x 30 km versus the previous 20 x 15 km) and supports larger force structures for adventurous players.
 This scenario pack provides an abundance of additional action for American, British, West German and Soviet forces set in the ‘Cold War gone hot’ of 1989.
 FEATURES The return of Flashpoint Germany, entirely remastered with the latest On Target Simulations engine.
Unit, map and other visuals have been upgraded to the latest wargaming standards.
Introduction of new game mechanics, available in Flashpoint Campaigns: Red Storm.
Revamped Battle Maps and introduction of a gigantic new map called &quot;Eiterberg&quot;.
17 scenarios with 43 variations that simulate realistic what-if situations in an hypotetical &quot;Cold War gone hot&quot; war. </project:description>

About This Game
							Through the dense fog our hero noticed a dark silhouette of a dark castle. Eventually his old rain-soaked map brought him to his target. He didn&apos;t have anything with him except for his favorite sword and remainings of an old armor with an unusual device – a sword-breaker. The hero looked around and stepped on the castle bridge... 
 This game is about a hero who, as fate would have it, finds himself in an abandoned castle. There will be many obstacles on his way to the treasure hidden somewhere inside, with most remarkable adversaries he will have to face and mysteries to unravel. All this to receive his well-earned reward in the end!
 &quot;Swordbreaker The Game&quot; gives you a rare opportunity to find yourself in interactive fiction, where each player has their own storyline to develop. Every action or decision will have an effect on how the story unfolds and how it all ends. Some moves you make will change your character&apos;s karma, and others can lead you to the darkest corners of the castle, so be careful! Because any step you take may turn out to be the last one!
 Main features of the game:  - A compelling totally non-linear game story
- Various endings
- A huge mysterious castle
- Lots of exciting locations and events
- Impressive enemies and inhabitants of the castle
- Absolutely stunning artwork
- Achievement system						</project:description>

About This Game
  Empires Of Creation is the debut title from Bundle Of Sticks studios.
 Empires Of Creation is an up-and-coming Sci-Fi themed sandbox game in which the player takes on the role of a fleet commander, destined to make his name in the galaxy and ultimately conquer it.  Forge relationships with surrounding empires and use your wit to establish a galactic monopoly. Colonize nearby habitable stars to expand your presence in the cosmos. The universe is your playground in this dynamic economy.
 Enjoy fast paced, high intensity fleet battles with enemy ships as you race to the top. Whosoever can prove his superiority in the field and in the diplomatic sphere shall come out victorious. 
 -Gameplay-  After procedurally generating a spiral galaxy in Empires of Creation the player will find themselves with nothing but potential and an AI that has no regard for life programmed to do whatever is required to conquer the galaxy. Initially the player you will recruit ships from colony worlds that are barely able to scratch the armada of empire fleets, from this point you will proceed to upgrade them to formidable combat hardened battles fleets and eventually destroyers of worlds. The game turns from being a predominantly self centered ordeal, to a risk factoring strategy game as you obtain your first colonizer followed by claiming your first colony and beginning your own empire. Expansion and hostility will find you involved in galactic warfare with entire empires but this is essential if the player wants to obtain the ultimate goal of conquering the galaxy.

About This Game
Welcome to Parallels  Journey through the utterly surreal, simplistic and colourful world that is Parallels. What seems like an easy relaxed journey in the beginning, is destined to become fraught with danger as you progress through the Parallel paths of ever changing light. 
 Bounce and roll through stunning colour changes as you drop through the levels, remember you always stay safe on the white. Avoid collapsing walls and ceilings, platforms on the move and shadowed shapes that will follow you to your destruction. With a simple one click/key jump system, you’ll need fast reactions, cunning timing and nerves of steel to reach the safety of the Parallel checkpoints and save your game progress. 
 Don’t be deceived, Parallels is a relatively chilled out puzzle escape platforming experience, but let your guard down and it becomes brutally hard to find the way out!
 Features:  - Tons of puzzle levels 
- Checkpoints to save your process
- Easy on the eyes 
- Ambient Soundtrack						</project:description>

About This Game
							This game takes place in the same universe as our upcoming tittle Secluded; you take control of a lone astronaut that lands on the surface of a planet, miles away from the other members. And it’s your job to meet up with the other astronauts. 

This game is based on constantly moving, as your suit leaks oxygen at random times. You must also avoid hazards that accrue on the planets, such as falling debris and asteroid strikes. This game is Free to play and experimental in some ways. We want the player survive in their own way and not have the game hold their hand through the experience, the games objectives are randomized so the locations change each time you play, and once you die that&apos;s it. 

FEATURES

About This Game
							Rothschild: The Sheep will Wake is a procedurally generated first person horror game in which the Rothschild family dominates the world. The player fills the shoes of Jordan Baker, a journalist sent to investigate the hospitalization of Kane Rothschild. Little did he know, this rabbit hole just doesn&apos;t end.
 Overall Rothschild is 6 chapters long, each being released separately; but all being apart of the same game.  Once you&apos;ve purchased ANY chapter you&apos;re also purchasing the rest of the chapters. We can&apos;t stress that enough, ONE purchase defines purchasing the complete game. Chapter Zero is the very first chapter, acting as a prologue to the main story and our launch for EA. 
 Features:  (* = In Development) Open world environment: Within Rothschild there are no closed door or blocked doors. There are no &apos;invisible walls&apos;, and you can explore as far and as freely as you dare. What you do and how you go about unfolding the story is completely up to you.
 Dynamic Horror System: We take great pride in our D.H.S. which allows us to procedurally generate almost everything you encounter in Rothschild. You&apos;ll never know what lies beyond the threshold of light. Everything aside from the environment itself (in some aspects) is randomly produced to provide a slightly unique and different story for every player.
 Non-Linear Story: With Rothschild we&apos;d like to tell the story from ONLY the characters eyes. This means minimal cut scenes to watch and high engagement. How you go about the story, who you talk to, and what you choose to say all shape your personal and unique experience.
 *Shhh!!: Plug up your Mic to you can be connected to the game! Make a noise, release a yelp, or murmer a cry... and they will hear. Although this feature is still being perfected and is in still in development we&apos;re very excited to announce it! And let your worries flee, we&apos;ve prototype this quite a bit and implementation in a future update is sure to come soon :)
 *Skill System: Develop and hone your skills in Rothschild to help you survive, but what perks will you attain? Will you be a sly, stealth investigative journalist with a keen sense of awareness? Or are you more the type to be better at running and hiding?						</project:description>

About This Game
							The Extinction is an indie 2.5D Space Shooter. In the current stage, the game focuses on the arcade type of gameplay, which can offer a lot of fun. Player has an opportunity to play four Game-Modes including the most expanded one - Side Campaign. In this gamemode player has to invade planets which provide money and resources like iron or fuel, then protect them with defensive buildings and finally - get to the boss of the solar system and destroy him. While playing this gamemode, you can always complete side missions, to get more money and XP and explore, freely the void between the planets to search for some more resources.Profile, ranks, experience
Player earns experience by destroying enemies, invading planets, completing side missions, buying and upgrading weapons or even trading. Along with experience, player keeps getting promoted and earns new ranks.Game Economy - iron, fuel and others (related to Side Campaign)
In game, player has three major resources - Iron, fuel and Hi-Tech parts. These resources can be used to either trade them for money or crafting your own custom weapons. Each resource has it&apos;s own value, so obviously fuel is more valuable then iron, because iron is easier to obtain. You can get this resource by invading planets, digging in the space mine and while exploring the space. For an example, hi-tech parts are a hidden resource and you can get it only if you find it.Customization
Since, it&apos;s pretty neat to have your own models or images in games we have prepared te feature called &quot;Custom Weapon Crafting&quot;. This ability, uses your custom image to display how the fired bullet looks like. In the future, as it is in early access we&apos;re planning to add more customizable thingies, like ships.Side Missions, side activities
For now, the player can complete a few side missions like &quot;Have 500 units of iron&quot;, &quot;Destroy 3 bombs on the different planets&quot;, &quot;Have 3 profit buildings&quot; etc. As a reward you can get money and XP.Difficulty - Is it hard or casual?
The game is not hard, but sometimes it makes player to stick around the map a while longer due to the better, faster, and stronger enemies, but with propertly armed and upgraded weapons - it&apos;s not a struggle at all!Story
Since the story mode is not completed yet and we have only semi-story, side campaign mode.. It&apos;s pretty unknown right now. I surely want to expand the game, make it even more &quot;sandboxy&quot; and procedural in the Story Mode. 
 For now, We have come up with a little storyline for a side campaign.. but it&apos;s told in the trailer.  If you haven&apos;t watched it, do it right now! :)						</project:description>

        <project:gameName>Overdosed - A Trip To Hell</project:gameName>
        <project:description>
About This Game
Overview
Overdosed is a crazy fast paced, adrenaline fuelled trip to remember! In this top down shooter the player is on an intense experimental form of LSD and as a result they must battle against hordes of nightmarish creatures in randomly generated roguelike adventures and arena style levels. Basically run around with an Uzi in each hand wildly spewing bullets in all directions. Fun for all the family!
  Influenced by the colourful craziness of Hotline Miami, Overdosed takes those run and gun elements and ramps up the intensity as you scramble looking for cash piles, ammo and more drugs while defending yourself against many terrifying enemies.Gamemodes ADVENTURE This is the main roguelike mode where the main goal is to progress through 5 randomly generated stages, each one with their own unique set of objectives to complete in order to progress. Every level will be different each time you play. Pickups like ammo/cash/drugs spawn at random locations which you must hunt for if you want to survive!
 Once you die you go back to stage 1... however you can come back stronger! Adventure features a hub area where you can spend the cash you find on new weapons, permanent upgrades and ammo. So with each playthrough you will punch that little bit harder!
 Adventure also features bonus objectives which reward you for tasks like kicking enemies down a pit of death or defending a giant mound of coke. It’s a risk/reward situation where you can make a quick buck or lose it all and perish under a horde of enemies.
 ARENA As you start with just Dual Uzi’s and limited ammo, fight increasingly frantic waves of enemies and earn points to purchase additional weapons and gadgets within the level. There’s no order of unlocks so you can play it your way and spend your points however you like. Each wave gets harder than the last with more enemy numbers and the introduction of new enemy types.
 2 new adventures and arenas
Yeah, you read that right! We are planning on making this game 3 times bigger than it is now when we come out of early access.
  HAUNTED THEME: This theme will resemble a haunted house where the furniture comes alive and attacks you. Imagine a bear skin rug suddenly leaping up and charging at you to rip your face off! Sounds delightful doesn’t it?
 HOSPITAL THEME: Just a normal visit to the hospital really - fight through an eerie labyrinth of a hospital where the only occupants are hungry infected zombies.
 Each new theme will have their own set of enemy types with unique characteristics and abilities.Boss Battles
The conclusion to each adventure will feature a boss fight to test your skill to the metal!Steam Online Leaderboards
A leaderboard system will be integrated for the arena stats so you can compare and compete with others around the globe to see who can reach the highest wave!Full controller support
What’s a twin stick shooter without the ability to use twin sticks!? An early access game that’s what! We will be working on getting full controller support including the steam controller to work in gameplay and the menus.						</project:description>

About This Game
&quot;Life is hard&quot; is a strategy/village management game. Your aim here is to control a tribe. Defend your village, harvest resources, expand your town, colonize the islands, upgrade your tools and weapons and contact with other civilizations. There is no specific aim in our game. You can do whatever you want.
 Expand your village: build farms and houses, upgrade tools in blacksmith, trade with your neighbors. It’s your destiny to create the most powerful town in this amazing world!
 Conquer the world by fire &amp; sword or with power of diplomacy. What would you choose – to help your neighbors to deal with the Vikings for iron ore or to rob them to get more? To pay the Normans tribute or to refuse, condemning your nation to war? To trade with the caravan or to loot it? Make your choice, but remember: every medal has its reverse...
 Prove that your civilization is the most cultured by building the Wonder of the World! You have to put many resources in that project. But it’s worth it, isn’t it?
 Whatever you choose, your path won’t be easy. Your plans can be ruined by one of many random events. But it’s no need to get upset! In the moments of crisis there come those, who are the only support of justice. Those, who are ready to lead people into the thick of battle. Heroes – braves, who are lead by you and ready to support people in need. They are ready to die for their ideas. Every one of them has unique talents that can help you in different situations.
 The belief of your people is strong not only in heroes, but in the God. Choose your patron, but be careful: that choice will affect the whole game. Pray your god and he’ll give you talent of a trader. Or, maybe, the forest itself will raise against your enemies? Will he reveal the secrets of construction and craft to you? It’s your choice. Choose wise, because life of the whole nation is on you!
 Remember that life is hard. Whatever you choose, remember, you path will be thorny. </project:description>

About This Content
							Life on Mars DLC

Play the game on Mars, with a new visuals and effects. This is one of many new planets we will be adding to this pack.

This game takes place in the same universe as our upcoming tittle Secluded; you take control of a lone astronaut that lands on the surface of a planet, miles away from the other members. And it’s your job to meet up with the other astronauts. 

This game is based on constantly moving, as your suit leaks oxygen at random times. You must also avoid hazards that accrue on the planets, such as falling debris and asteroid strikes. This game is Free to play and experimental in some ways. We want the player survive in their own way and not have the game hold their hand through the experience, the games objectives are randomized so the locations change each time you play, and once you die that&apos;s it. 

FEATURES 
	. Gravity Effects 
	. Randomized Endings 
	. Asteroid Strikes &amp; Hazards 
	. First Person Experience and Future VR Plugins						</project:description>

Reviews
“The simple yet pithy strategic layer gives battles new weight, new meaning... The new turn-based strategic game works rather well. During the course of a 48 month/turn campaign, there are thought-provoking choices aplenty. Should I invest in another shore battery at Mobile or invest in something more mobile at Mobile? Should I expand my merchant fleet in the hope of generating some quick trade receipts, or focus on constructing the seagoing warships necessary to protect that merchant fleet? Am I ready to attack Key West, or would it be better to concentrate on strengthening the blockade there?”
Rock Paper Shotgun  “Strategic Layer. That this even exists is one of my favorite things about this game. Totem Games avoided this pitfall by designing a strategic layer to the game from which the tactical battles are generated. This feature adds replayability and puts weight behind the battles you fight.   Tactical Layer. The graphics are surprisingly high-end for a small studio. The ship models are very good quality and have re-skins at different levels of damage, showing pockmarks and scorch marks from cannon hits. Fires, when they occur, look very nice, and the smoke from fires and the powerplants is very well done. Ships list when taking on water. The quality of the water is near immaculate.”

About This Content
    64 new racial techs create personality-specific developments to parallel the existing Thoraxian Evolutions.  The Thoraxians can&apos;t have ALL the fun.
    New Tech Race game mode: win the science race before any of the main races do.
   Techs now have &quot;side effects&quot; that can be directly beneficial to you -- or other races -- in combat.
    Champions: enemies that show up in combat (more on harder difficulties) and use flagship abilities that were previously your exclusive domain.
    Gorgeous new Ring World planet type, home to a very fragile ecosystem.
    More new stuff: 12 techs for everybody, 7 flagship abilities, 2 formidable turrets, and 1 new mission.About The Expansion This expansion is focused on filling in all sorts of small pieces of the game that could use a bit of extra content, as well as adding some larger features with a surprisingly high impact.  Take tech side effects, for instance: they add dual motivations to getting any tech.  Do I want that tech in order to give it to some other race, or do I perhaps just want it to beef up myself a tad?
 All of the races feel more unique in terms of how they evolve based on their new race-specific techs in the tech tree, and there are even 8 Hydral techs that you can go on a new mission type in order to find.  Champions add a new element to combat where you may need to avoid a specific enemy ship that is doing... something strange and unexpected.  You can easily tell the champion ships by their purple glow, and they have a way of exerting a bit of gravity -- so to speak -- on their part of the battlefield.
 Last but not least, the new Tech Race game mode sees you focused on techs to the exclusion of all the usual politics or conquest.  One of the tricky things is of course that you can&apos;t let any of the other races take over the solar system while you do this.  But even more so, you have to partner with other races in order to advance your own scientific interests.  Just don&apos;t partner with any race for too long, or you might find them leaving you in the dust...						</project:description>

							Ever dreamt of waterskiing in a Japanese Zero-fighter? Perhaps in the Phi Phi Islands area in Thailand? Then our Paradise Island DLC might be something for you, it includes a new map two amphibious planes (one yet to be revealed, we&apos;re still in Early Access, after all) and the ability to land (and ski!) on water.

Oh, even if you don&apos;t own the DLC, you can still play the Phi Phi Islands map and face off against enemy amphibious fighters, as long as the multiplayer host owns the DLC.						</project:description>

        <project:description>
About This Game
							It starts on the 4th day. Ever since you arrived on this planet, you&apos;ve felt a dark influence. You&apos;ve lost all memories of your previous self. Who you&apos;ve become is an even bigger mystery. The darkness hides the truth, and maybe it is in the darkness the truth should remain hidden. Something sinister has happened, but you don&apos;t know exactly what took place. These dark silent ones, why do they want to kill you? When death arrives, why does it start all over again... You know you have to escape this planet, and this endless time loop. Yet there is something itching your mind, something tells you you&apos;ll have to do more than just escape...
 Features  -Very subtle dark story told by collecting memory fragments
 -Enemies that increase in numbers as time goes by (spend too long and it will become very challenging)
 -Gather enough meteorite and fuel to power your spaceship to escape
 -Robots allies that will help in collecting resources, or resources you&apos;ve tagged
 -This planet was named after the blind idiot god Azathoth. When traversing outside the base the darkness can be blinding, it is essential to use your flashlight and radar to help find memory fragments and meteorite. This planet was also named after Azathoth for many other reasons...
 -You can get sustenance in your base, but getting food requires going out and scavenging buildings
 -To escape requires balancing your body&apos;s needs with keeping the base running along with collecting fuel and meteorite for your spaceship. How you balance these task&apos;s will determine how quickly you can escape the planet. Not paying enough attention to your sustenance level, and being too far from base will lead to death
 -Saving is an important resource. It requires converted matter, in which you can enter an altered reality with the same time, and resources accumulated along with respawning everything. You can also use it to restore your health, but be wary it will reset bullet counts and weapons. When you choose to save will become strategic
 -The silent ones blend in with complete darkness, you&apos;ll have to rely on the reflection of their skin to shoot them correctly. Be wary take too long to aim,  and they&apos;ll teleport
 --Simple Multiplayer  -Invade other worlds with the ability of summoning a huge silent one(Time it right and give other players a great jump scare)
 -Play from the perspective of the enemy, and see how they really perceive you
    Continuous Support  Nightmare on Azathoth will continuously be updated from the nightmare realm.

        <project:description>
About This Game
							Step into the epic adventure of the legendary pirate Captain Henry Morgan. Inspired by true events from 16th century, Caribbean Odyssey is a beautiful tale of loyalty, love, betrayal and revenge. Explore a lavish and colorful world of secrets in 2.5D. The journey of Captain Morgan takes you through Caribbean islands, caves, dungeons, jungles and populated cities. Unfold the mysterious truth as the most wanted pirate of the Caribbean flees from the city of Port Royal to escape the wrath of evil Governor Thomas Modyford. Does he really have the map to the mythical City of Gold?  
   Caribbean Odyssey is the first installment of a long tale that tells a compelling &amp; epic story of the legendary character, Captain Henry Morgan. The story begins at Port Royal in 1655, where Henry Morgan comes to see a mysterious woman named Merry Carleton. Henry Morgan had just previously returned from Panama, where he was sent by the current Governor of Port Royal, Sir Thomas Modyford. Captain Henry successfully crushed the Spanish Army and laid the capital under siege for weeks. Eventually the Spaniards were forced to pay him a large ransom to avoid the total burning and pillaging of Panama City.
   Governor Sir Thomas Modyford was a trusted fellow of the British Crown and was known for his cunning and greed for gold. He sent Henry Morgan to Panama because taking over Panama City would open the doors for the Royal Navy to strengthen its stronghold over the open waters. Unfortunately, in a cruel twist of fate, the Spaniards and the British Royal Crown had already signed a peace contract before Henry Morgan’s conquest. As a result, Henry Morgan’s actions are decreed as piracy, and the Royal Crown declares him as an outlaw and places a hefty bounty on his head. The cunning Governor Sir Thomas Modyford saw an opportunity to at once please the Royal Crown and feed his greed by agreeing with the Spaniards to go on a joint expedition to hunt down the mysterious and rumored City of Gold in exchange of taking down the outlaw who single handedly took out the Spanish forces in Panama. Now Captain Morgan is caught in the cross hairs of the Crown’s Justice and the vengeful Spaniards.

“&quot;hmmm... I think the person from SELFIE drowned in something and some guy made a romhack to come into the real world.&quot;”
Attack on gaming  “Uriel’s Chasm 2 is not Brecht’s-simplest-words. In fact, if there were someone whose personal mission was to hunt down my poetic credo and shit all over it, it would be Dylan Barry. But it does what I want art to do. It tore my heart to shreds.”
Unwinnable  “There are complexities at work in Uriel&apos;s Chasm 2 that will take a little thought and a lot of practice to come to light, but reaching that understanding is a satisfying journey. Plus awesome blue bongo dude.”

About This Game
							Cross Set is a simple and brain-teasing new number puzzle game.

Can you find the solution codes for the number puzzles?
The rule of the game is quite simple: make every row and column consist of each one of 1, 2, 3, 4,… out of the candidates of each cell.
But the gameplay will be much more profound if you actually play it.
Its impression and feeling during gameplay are somewhat like Sudoku&apos;s, but it&apos;s better in many ways.


Key Features:
 - 50+ unique levels
 - 17 Steam Achievements
 - Beautiful and calm BGMs

* All puzzle sets are different from the pre-distributed version.						</project:description>

About This Content
							Get everything you need to adventure in the Forgotten Realms on the exciting Sword Coast, home to the cities of Baldur&apos;s Gate, Waterdeep, and Neverwinter. Crafted by the scribes at Green Ronin in conjunction with the Dungeons &amp; Dragons team at Wizards of the Coast, the Sword Coast Adventurer&apos;s Guide provides D&amp;D fans with a wealth of detail on the places, cultures, and deities of northwestern Faerûn.
 The Sword Coast Adventurer&apos;s Guide is also a great way to catch up on recent events in the Forgotten Realms, to get background on locations featured in the Rage of Demons storyline coming in September, and to learn the lore behind video games like Neverwinter and Sword Coast Legends.
 Here are just a few of the features you&apos;ll find in the Sword Coast Adventurer&apos;s Guide:
 Immersive Adventuring: This campaign sourcebook provides players and Dungeon Masters material for creating vibrant fantasy stories along the Sword Coast.
New Character Options: The book offers new subclass options, such as the Purple Dragon Knight and the Swashbuckler, for many of the classes presented in the Player&apos;s Handbook, as well as new subraces and backgrounds specific to the Forgotten Realms.
Adventure in the Forgotten Realms: Discover the current state of the Forgotten Realms and its deities after the Spellplague and the second Sundering. You&apos;ll also get updated maps of this area of the Realms.
Compatible with Rage of Demons storyline: Make characters for use with the Out of the Abyss adventure and fight back the influence of the demon lords in the Underdark below the Sword Coast.
Insider Information: Learn the background behind locations, such as Luskan and Gracklstugh, featured in the upcoming digital RPG, Sword Coast Legends, from n-Space. Dungeon Masters purchasing this module can use it to help expand the detail presented to players for other purchased adventures within the Forgotten Realms or to help craft unique experiences. Maps and descriptive text are provided for numerous locations in the world of Faerûn -- often with hotkeys that take you to more details.
 This Module Includes
the entire contents of Sword Coast Adventurer&apos;s Guide accessory, divided into a Campaign Guide module and a PLayer&apos;s Guide module
image handouts that can be shared with players collectively or individually
maps of overland areas in Faerûn
37 new portraits that players can use to represent their characters Requirements: A license for Fantasy Grounds (Standard or Ultimate) or an active license subscription, with the built-in 5E Ruleset.

Reviews
“Plays out on one of the greatest, most beautiful maps in strategy gaming history. It combines style, substance, and setting into a marvelous overall experience for both empire management and tactical combat.”
8.3/10 – IGN  “BEST STRATEGY GAME 2014 - Reinvents the 4X genre, mirroring what XCOM did for tactical turn-based games, and they have, as today Endless Legend brings the genre to new heights.”
9/10 – Hooked Gamers  “COMMENDATION FOR DESIGN 2014 - At every stage Endless Legend shines. Where it takes from the past, it puts its own spin on it. Where it innovates, it does so cautiously and mostly successfully. Amplitude Studios has created another astounding story-driven game, that really has taken the best bits of RTS, RPG and 4X. This is a game that wannabe developers should play and learn from.”

							Deep within the Coalsack Nebula waits the space-station DarkHack. 

Enter into this highly anomalous part of space to explore the mysterious station in order to find the Skin of Nesak, an armour so powerful it is rumoured to have one belonged to Nesak – the high priest of the Progenitors. Yet beware, this is a station consumed by darkness, where exploration must be done by the narrow beam of a torch. 

Features:
•	A highly atmospheric experience with a completely new torch/darkness system.
•	Powerful new armour.
•	A roguelike, in game, experience for those playing normal or ironman mode.						</project:description>

About This Content
Kumoon : VR Expansion Kit 01 for Oculus Rift DK2, SDK: pre-0.6, PC + Mac  Imagine leaning down over the robot body you inhabit, it&apos;s rotund belly giving way to the vertigo inducing view directly below you. If you haven&apos;t tried VR yet, it can be hard to envision the immersion involved in playing a game on a headmounted display. Just moving through a sparse space like the one we humbly offer you can be an eyeopening experience. 
   For those of you who have access to a DK2 headmounted display, this expansion sets up a playfield for both the thrillseeker and the purveyor of more placid pleasures. Our levels have a mix suitable to cater to both preferences for movement in a simulated environment. Some levels are specifically designed to give the creative freerunner scope for experimentation, but most are perfectly playable in both a passive or aggressive stance of play.
 If you don&apos;t have a DK2 but want to ensure we continue building for VR, you can consider buying this DLC to support indie VR development.
 Levels like Long Fall, the Spiral Tower and AnsaLattia are specifically built and perfected to give the VR player impressive scenes. Other levels have turned out to be fun in emergent ways, like learning to jump over the heart shaped gap in the Psychedelic Fissure level. The robot can be viewed in a mirror in the Tutorial levels, and it&apos;s head follows the players head pose. Head movement is limited to prevent viewing the interior of the robot or looking through walls. Leaning forwards to look down is specifically encouraged to navigate platforming level falling situations.
 An experienced VR player can move around at speed, but:
 a note for those susceptible to VR sickness  Toggle the speed to half-speed.
Use the analog sticks of your gamepad in a controlled fashion. You will be able to move about quite slowly at will. 
Skip levels which involve platforming.
 We have had players as young as 6, some who have never grasped a gamepad before, enjoying the game with no ill effect.
Grown men who surf and kitesurf on the other hand may feel quite ill. Please stop playing immediately on noticing discomfort. Try games like Vanguard-V for a guaranteed no-illness ride.
 on the Proper Procedure of Donning and Removing a Headmounted Display  Scenario : You are handed a clean, functioning HMD with a game running.
 ) Remove stray hair from face if needed, and if you have glasses check your spectacles can fit inside the hmd frame.
) Hold the mask in one hand and the back of the strap in the other.
) Place the mask on your face as you would a snorkeling mask.
) Pull the strap behind your head. This way your forehead avoids contact with the lenses. 
) Once the mask is placed, the skin around your eyes will be stretched out a little. Squint hard to loosen the fit.
) When removing the mask, take care to remove optional headphones first.
) Take the strap from the back of your head up and forwards, releasing the tension.
) Then remove the mask directly away from your face, again : to avoid touching your sweaty forehead to the lenses.
 on the efficacy of this Strange Technology  This plugin is built by hand for the ShiVa 3D Engine. It uses both headtracking and positiontracking, but does not use the rift sdk distortion, instead applying a traditional barrel distortion. On Windows, run in Extended Desktop mode, with Rift display as Primary Monitor.
 Oculus has dropped support for OSX after SDK 0.7, which is the primary motivation to publish this expansion as a separate Dlc, to motivate us to continue supporting this old experimental version in addition to the consumer versions coming next year. Mac users in particular will hopefully appreciate this gesture.
 We are already dreaming up our next VR game! Take Kumoon for a ride to guarantee more wizardry!						</project:description>

About This Game
							Quatro Luzes (from the Portuguese &quot;Four Lights&quot;) is a game where you have to swap between 4 different worlds to proceed, using your brain and skill.
When the game starts, you only have access to a white, blank world. As you proceed, collecting spirits along the way, new Light Cores become available, allowing you to visit the Red, Green, Yellow and Blue worlds. It is possible to alternate between them on the fly, allowing for a very dynamic gameplay.
Some unique objects are particular of a world. For example, steam machines will only work in the Red world, since it is the hottest one. Wood trampolines only exist in the Green world, and so on.
  22 levels to explore, alternating between 4 different worlds, each with different mechanics.
Lots of collectibles! 689 Wisps and 42 Spirits await! Some are easy to get, some are downright impossible (unless you are skilled enough).
Intuitive controls: you move around, jump and change the world around you as fast as a button click.
Auto-saving: your progress is saved automatically in a profile, so you can restart from where you were.
Main ending and  extra ending, unlocked at 100% completion. </project:description>

About This Game
							As the daughter of a detective, Azure has always been a curious child.

When she finds something, or someone, out of the ordinary, she has a compulsion to watch on and make sense of what she&apos;s seen.

But on this particular night, Azure&apos;s curiosity proves to be her undoing.

After stalking a suspicious figure through the night, Azure stumbles across an odd, black box, bearing alien writing. And within that box she finds a small ring, just her size, with writing matching that of the box. Without thinking, Azure picks up the ring, and the moment she does, footsteps appear behind her.

Panicked, Azure flees the scene. She runs home to safety, examines the ring, and wonders why she risked her safety for such a small trinket. But the moment she puts the ring on, Azure realizes she&apos;s gotten more than she bargained for.

The footsteps belonged to a small alien girl, Sienna, who explains that the ring cannot be removed. It is an alien mating ring stolen by the FBI during an intergalactic peace conference. The ring is the key to bringing peace to the planets, and as the daughter of the emperor of Mars, Sienna came to earth to retrieve it.

But the ring has already chosen its host, Azure, and is now bound to her forever. And with it, Sienna too has been bound to the human girl, fated to be her lover.						</project:description>

About This Game
							HotLead is an arcade third-person shooter set in industrial surroundings. The game takes the players in a world  where mankind has reached the deepest corners of space and has encountered new alien species. Humans wanted to defend themselves in the event of a war for space supremacy and built droid bases on strategic planets, which were each supposed to protect a certain area and launch a defensive attack in the event of war.

But the war never came and the droids were left abandoned, while their mission still remains the same – to attack anyone that might seem hostile. This leaves open the possibility of a battle happening by chance any time, where droids could attack even a peaceful visitor. 

Humans created an enhanced species to help them decommission these settlements and the remaining droids. They form a division of soldiers with special skills called HotLead.

The central mission requires players to disable an enemy base and then get to the extraction point. To complete their mission they will need to go through a series of smaller, independent tasks – each more challenging than the previous one. Through these side-missions players will uncover and use new skills. Each enemy has its own ability, so they need to adapt their strategy based on their opponents.

The game requires players to use all their functions and skills and make fast decisions. Among the skills they could use, the most helpful are running and wall climbing, using their environment and surroundings as ammo, dodging, special moves or magic.						</project:description>

About This Game
							Bleeding Border is a first person 3d survival horror game in which the player must escape through the top of a monster infested building using his own blood as the only defense mechanism.

The game starts with Zoey, losing blood from a fresh amputated arm, after a scavenge incursion went south and all her team members were killed by the apparently indestructible PaleOnes.
Zoey escaped thanks to a rare genetic mutation that makes her blood act like poison in contact with the PaleOnes bodies(it&apos;s a shame that to find that she first had to lose her arm :( )

Bleeding Border is inspired in old school games like ResidentEvil and Silent Hill, adding modern elements of gameplay and aesthetics.
In this game the player needs to hide, run and avoid , and only as the last resource use blood, because as soon as the player hurts himself he will start to bleed, and die if his wounds are not treated in time.

Needless to say is an adventure with a lot of gore and blood filled action.						</project:description>

About This Content
							Our story begins with the death of Gustav Platte, your father’s older brother. In this world, he was a strong and dour man, who had seen much of the world and partook in his fair share of sins. None will dare to guess what awaits him in the next world. Through the many festivities he participated in he never seemed to revel in them. His eyes held a heaviness only matched by the weight of his flail. Some joked that this heaviness suggested the man had passed through Iron Forest. And at times it was hard to say, whether they were jokes at all.

The tale begins with a death, but it will not be last before the story’s conclusion.

Gustav’s estate was divided in accordance with his will. Felsen Castle and the adjoining villages passed into your brother’s ownership. Other relatives partitioned the estate of Ludahof, the land and a fortune worth several thousand guldens. You, however, inherited just a sword and a small casket. You opened the latter to find two objects.

The one was a metal oak leaf similar in size to a real one. At first it seemed a decoration to you but you knew the difference between silver and steel. The edge pierced your hand and you wondered who would make a decoration that could wound? Curious, you scrutinized the leaf closer. The veins were were so thin, its folds and imperfections so true to life. The spots and the play of shading was unlike any engraving you had ever seen that there was no doubt in your mind that this was not made by a human hand…

The other object inside the casket was a map.						</project:description>

        <project:description>
About This Game
							As space-faring free ranger, Cluck Yegger, you’ve been shot out of the sky by none other than your old arch nemesis, Colonel Zanderz. Your disabled ship is running on limited auxiliary solar power that charges during the daytime. But at night, confined to the cockpit, you must survive unwelcomed visits from a brood of peckish genetically modified poultroid looking for a late night snack. Can you survive seven nights to ESCAPE PLANET POULTROID? 

Gameplay: 
- Monitor cameras to keep tabs on the advancing poultroid. 
- Listen for signs of unseen intruders. 
- Activate bright lights to ward-off the nocturnal creatures. 
- Activate infrared night vision to stealthily spot critters lurking in and around your ship. 
- Seal cockpit doors and shield as a last line of defense. 

This is a Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s style parody game with some new mechanics, fun artwork, humor and VO based on characters from the upcoming adventure game, SpaceVenture, being released by the Two Guys From Andromeda(original creators of the Space Quest series)

Genre: 
Survival horror with a funny, kid-friendly(playtest with ages 10 and up), sci-fi theme.						</project:description>

About This Content
Only the host needs to own this DLC.  2-6 Players | Ages 13 &amp; Up
 ~60 minutesBackstory You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they’ve ever known. You may use them at your whim.
 The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.
 The Euphorians aren’t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand—they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.
 There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterran, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they’ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.Object of the Game In Euphoria, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.
 Euphoria is a worker-placement game where dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker’s knowledge–that is, their level of awareness that they’re in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your workers gets too high, one of them might desert you.
 You also have 2 elite recruit cards at your disposal. One has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game…or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.
 Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts—especially matching pairs—and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.
 Three distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history. What are you willing to sacrifice to build a better dystopia?						</project:description>

Camera in the game is a still camera which switches to various angles according to the location that the character arrived. The character will face unusual things and it seems like she is not in the world she used to be. The player must solve the puzzle in order to pass to the next scene.						</project:description>

 Graphics I usually steer to more realistic visuals, yet I&apos;ve really come to love how this one turned out in the game. Mills, castles, ships, metal balls and pumpkins.
 Have fun!

Reviews
“It&apos;s one of those rare games that completely stopped me in my tracks.”
Jake Muncy, Wired  “A story game in which you return to a realm time forgot: AOL Instant Messenger.”
Nathan Grayson, Kotaku  “It reminded me both of Digital: A Love Story and Catholic-guilt-simulator Catherine. Which are not bad games to be compared to.”
Brendan Caldwell, Rock Paper Shotgun

About This Game
							Waking up as Bennet Helms you find yourself in a unknown place, however you do see your family which questions you deeply. 
You remember almost nothing but you see that something is wrong with this place, and given a choice to either just run or find your family.
 Survive, look for clues and items, hide and try to uncover the mysterious truth of the Visual Corporation.Key features:Sanity
Sanity controls you. It will decide many things, and you can even use it to your advantage. But what is it actually?
The main character is Bennet Helms has a brain tumor on the cerebral part of the brain (The part which controls communication,  feelings, sense of reality, etc.). The tumor however can be contained with constant taking pills. 
 Now, a few effects of the Sanity are:
 Makes the player hallucinate things.
Spawns critters (&quot;They can, and they will hurt you&quot;, the lower the sanity the more critters will come to hunt you)
Decreased vision field. (Depends on the %(percentage) of the players sanity)
Lowers your mental condition (Highlighting of things will be drastically decreased)
45% Critters starts start spawning
25% - Walk/Sprint slower 
15% - Disabling the ability to sprint 
10% - Black/White picture
5% - &quot;C-Condition&quot; - You will be very fast, you will ignore pain of the critters (This means you won&apos;t be effected if a critter pushes you, for example but you will receive damage), ability to see far objects, medication will be highlighted.
*By hurting yourself you can go down to 15% of your HP (hitpoints). Every self-injury gives the sanity bar 20% sanity. WCD
To simplify WCD is the &quot;brain&quot; of the Demented world. However it depends entirely on the players Health and Sanity (We will get to that in a moment). Now what does WCD do? It:
 Changes the world (A wall was there buddy? Well now it isn&apos;t.)
Changes the perception of many things
Spawns Critters (Critters are the &quot;monsters&quot;)
Adds &quot;corruption&quot; to the world
Plays trick with your mind
 System Shutdown (SS) - Changes the power in the facility.
And other
Radiation Radiation is also a strong part of the game, as it can be rewarding but can be quite opposite as well. Also it can stop the decaying of Sanity but as the Radiation is higher it will hurt you too! Since it is a big part we cannot reveal all of the effects of the radiation.
Some effects of Radiation are:
 Slows, or stops sanity from decaying. Depends on the percentage of the radiation.
Even with little radiation you lose bits of health. It depends on the percentage of the radiation.
40+ REMs - Occasionally image blurring, and noises in head.
85+REMs - Walk/Sprint a lot slower, bad reflexes, decreased hearing.
Future Development Make the WCD a heavy impact on the game, by changing, adding or removing whole parts of the map.
Add more effects to the Sanity [For instance: heavy blurring, flashbacks of past, etc.]
Add more effects to the Health[For instance: Add a bleed feature, when low on hp, to fall down sometimes]
Improve the A.I - I have a great idea for you and am developing it as we speak! It&apos;ll be a lot of fun [By fun I mean in your most immediate death]
Implementing Physic Engine [Ability to drag objects, boxes etc.]
Optimize and polish textures, models and UI
More intractable objects and voice overs for characters
A lot more to come!  </project:description>

Reviews
“Ever since Monument Valley first came out, I’ve been hooked on the Escheresque art style, so I love seeing new games come out that carry this particular look and feel to it. And since puzzles are one of my favorite genres, it seems that Hocus is just a perfect fit for me, and anyone else who likes the genre.”
80/100 – AppAdvice  “But there’s still something to be said for a game so focused on one single, brilliant idea, and Hocus is a fine example of that.”
80/100 – Touch Arcade  “Hocus, a brain-twisting puzzler which shot to the top of the App Store charts this weekend, leverages that impulse in a game that would surely entertain Escher himself.”
80/100 – Gamezebo

About This Game
							Welcome to the future of collectible card games! Face Off XL combines the best features of online card games with exciting animated action when you and your opponent Face Off in this free-to-play, WWII-themed, tactical card game. Build your deck of weapons and units from over 400 collectible cards, and send them forth to rain down destruction on your enemy. Constructing the right deck is only the beginning. To win, you&apos;ll need to outmaneuver your opponent on the 24-square game board. Advance your troops and destroy your enemy&apos;s command center. Make him rue the day he met you! And in XL, players of the original Face Off can do it all in a much richer, HD gameplay experience that packs in graphics and design optimized for display on systems with dedicated graphic cards.
 Every card has a different mix of movement and attack traits as well as special abilities. Be ready for heavy bombers flying over the game board and dropping deadly ordnance on their targets, and V-2 rockets pummelling every card in play. And beware of exotic weapons such as man-eating plants! Well played combinations of basic units can overcome the strongest rare card. Do you want to rush your foes with a deck of cheap, fast-but-weak units, or use more powerful cards to damage and disrupt the enemy while you build strength and prepare for your final attack? The choice is yours! 
 There are currently three factions to choose from (with at least three more on the way), each offering a unique selection of cards. Discover which strategies work best against the heavy tanks of the European Alliance, the aggressive forces of the United Republic, or the swift and agile tactics of the Shogun Empire. 
 Join the battle now! Card games will never be the same.
 Features:
Support for 8 languages.
High resolution graphics optimized for computers with discrete graphics cards.
400+ cards to collect.
Card crafting system lets you turn the cards you don&apos;t want into cards you need.
PVE, PVP and Arena modes.
Short-but-sweet tutorial that also earns you a card pack. </project:description>

About This Game
							In the year 20XX a confident, young horologist by the name of Strike is inadvertently transported into the past while attempting to repair a mysterious, abandoned clock tower. Endeavoring to return to the future, Strike must fix both the time machine and the island’s dysfunctional family who are responsible for much of the clock’s disrepair.
 As the spiritual successor to Cat Poke, Tick Tock Isle plays like a puzzle platform game that relies heavily on story, character interaction, creative thinking, and poking.‬

About This Game
							Enter the vast lands of Communia, the magical planet that goes on forever. Or at least it looks that way. Several hundred colonies later people still have reported absolutely no end in sight and no familiar sights whatsoever. Goes without saying that it&apos;s an easy job to find an hitherto uninhabited place and claim it as your own. So take command of a pair of villagers, help them build and grow and expand your village...until it turns into a town, a duchy, a kingdom. When that becomes unsatisfactory, turn your kingdom into an empire, conquer your smaller neighbors, trade with your bigger neighbors, raid and explore, send heroes on missions and grow, grow, grow!So what is this? Much like the title says, the game has its roots in the &quot;idle&quot; genre and indeed it was such when it first started out. But it has evolved into so much more that, in the current incarnation, I can proudly say it&apos;s a full-fledged civilization builder.
Idle Civilization offers depth and complexity that most idle games do not. Yes, you will see big numbers, yes, you will only go upwards and rarely downward, yes you will have a prestige system and other classic elements, but you will have so much more to manage and entertain yourself with than in your average game in the genre.Alright, so what should we look forward to? - over 30 buildings
- over 60 researches
- 6 deities to worship with unique powers
- a randomized map full of towns and villages to conquer on each colony
- ruins to explore in search of ancient magical fragments
- mighty heroes to send on epic adventures to gain loot and glory
- unique wonders of the world
- diplomacy and cultural events
- random events
- lots of achievements
- a compelling colony system
- offline progress
- and more... (there&apos;s always more and more)So what this game isn&apos;t This game isn&apos;t something like Sid Meier&apos;s Civilization. This is a management game where you oversee your civilization from various panels and buttons and sliders and commands. Well I guess you can see that from the screenshots and videos but it doesn&apos;t hurt to state it again.And who are you? I&apos;m a fledgling developer from Romania, working on this project mostly alone (with help from a dear writer friend for the lore, game newspaper and quest texts/direction) and hoping to bring you something that you will enjoy for hours upon hours. Others have!Wait, others have already enjoyed this? Yes, I&apos;ve been working on this game since early 2015 and the game started out as a browser game and it&apos;s currently enjoyed over 500,000 plays. You can still play it on Kongregate but the Steam version will have features, wonders, areas and generally content that the web version will not have going forward. I feel the game has matured enough so that it can be considered a full (albeit small) indie game that deserves a PC release. If you feel the same way, please vote for it. If you don&apos;t like it, please let me know what exactly you would like to see or what bothers you.

Reviews
“Chaos Reborn is quite simply the best strategy game on PC this year.”
Kotaku  “Chaos Reborn is already a brilliant update of an absolute classic ... There&apos;s every reason to be excited about Chaos Reborn&apos;s future but, unlike too many other Early Access games, it&apos;s a game worth being excited about right now as well.”
Eurogamer  “I like it a lot, and it’s barely begun. So far at least, Chaos is well under control.”

About This Content
							The original Monster RPG game. This game was originally released for free in 2007. It&apos;s a turn-based JRPG like the sequel. Warning: very grindy, but for the sake of completing the series, and due to request, it has been released as free DLC. Playing this game is not required to play Monster RPG 2 (the stories are not connected.)

The story sees Coro searching for his son Eny who has gone missing. You must battle your way through the mountains to uncover clues. Monsters are afoot, so it won&apos;t be easy.						</project:description>

About This Content
							The Broken Mirror is the 22nd expansion to the game that defined the MMORPG genre, EverQuest! 
 This expansion has level scaling raids, new zones to explore, and must-have in-game items!
A goddess wakes and gazes into a looking glass. The reflection of her true nature fractures and breaks. Even as the looking glass shatters and the world around her dissolves, Anashti Sul only looks deeper still into the fragments as they drift away. When her fractured mind glimpses her surroundings, she discovers that she is adrift in an unknown time and place where gods and goddesses maintain direct influence over Norrath. A hunger for power wells within her, having passed many an age with no power at all and an upstart sitting in her place. With a whole new realm before her, she resolves to rule again!
 Anashti Sul&apos;s passage through a rift into this reality caused her to split into the two most dominant aspects of herself - life and decay. Fully aware of each aspect, she knows that both must command a plane of power lest she weaken entirely and crumble into the nothingness of The Void. And so she crafts a plot to infect the planes of Norrath with a war that threatens to collapse the balance of all life! Are you brave enough to face the might of a goddess who is ravenous to rule? Will you prevent the chaos she would unleash in all of Norrath?
 THE BROKEN MIRROR EXPANSION FEATURES:
  Level Scaling Raids – Instanced versions of Plane of Hate and Plane of Fear that scale for level 75-105 raids.
 7 Expansion Zones – 4 completely new zones and 3 revamped zones.
 Illusion Key Ring – Access your illusions in one easy location!
 New Quests, Heroic Adventures, Missions, and Additional Raids
 New Spells and AAs

About This Content
							At my window came a tapping...
 Sometimes a raven not just a raven, and those who have lost everything may do more than come a-gently tapping upon your chamber door. A missing pet, a ghostly girl, a madman in the woods; what is the strand that binds them all together at The Murmuring Fountain? Can your heroes quell the ghostly emanations of a tragic haunting that threaten to sow madness and tragedy.
 The Murmuring Fountain is an adventure for 1st-level characters using the 5th edition of the world&apos;s most famous roleplaying game. The adventure can be played on its own or in combination with The Fiddler&apos;s Lament, or as part of the beginning of a horror-themed Adventure Path campaign.&quot;

About This Content
							Music fit to wake the dead! 
 Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast, it&apos;s true, but some music truly is the devil&apos;s music. An orphan raised by gypsies, now full-grown but still lost and alone, must face once more the tragic curse that destroyed her past. Will her darkling music bring ruin to the village she now calls her home? Can the heroes earn the townsfolk&apos;s trust, or must innocence be sacrificed for the heroes to save town from the mysterious hauntings that plague a village huddled in the shadow of an accursed ruin? 
 This dark fantasy adventure is perfect for 1st-level characters using the 5th edition of the world&apos;s most famous role-playing game. The adventure can be played on its own or in combination with The Murmuring Fountain, or as part of the beginning of a horror-themed Adventure Path campaign.
 Requires: 5E ruleset

About This Game
							A keenly dark twist on the traditional murder mystery setting, The Deed is an Adventure/RPG game about getting away with murder. Arran Bruce, the rightful heir to Dunshiel House, returns to his family home after discovering that his abusive father has decided to disinherit him from his Will in favour of his sadistic, deranged young sister. In a fit of anger and greed, Arran has decided to remove his sister from the equation in order to restore his own inheritance. Can he manage to get away with such a foul deed?

* Every decision you make influences the outcome of the game
* Possible multiple endings.

-Meet the Family:
Explore Dunshiel House and encounter Arran&apos;s twisted, dysfunctional family and their servants. Take care, though - everything that you say or do can have an impact on the outcome of The Deed!

-Choose the Weapon:
A rope, a candlestick or good old-fashioned rat poison? There are many household items that can be put to a dark and nefarious use. Choose carefully from ten possible murder weapons, bearing in mind who might become a suspect as a result of your selection.

-Plant the Evidence:
Father, mother, maid, butler ... any of these individuals could take the blame for your heinous act, if you can find the right evidence, plant it in the right location and manage to raise the suspicions of the Inspector.

-Face the Inspector:
When the deed is done, it&apos;s time to face the music and be interviewed by the wily, perceptive Inspector. Can you dodge his questions and avert his suspicions? Will you walk away a free man? Many possible endings await ...						</project:description>

About This Game
The Time Window...  An incredible invention, developed over decades in secret, empowers humans to make their grandest dream a reality...  To travel through time!  At a hidden research facility, Rose and Kyo - the Time Tenshi (Time Angels) - voyage into the past in secret under the watchful eye of Tensai Shiro, the mastermind behind the Time Window, and Michelle, the base&apos;s Commander and Operations Manager.
 Since time travel is still dangerous and experimental, the Time Window has yet to be tested on male subjects, meaning only females can safely venture back into history. They seem to undergo some surprising changes to their bodies in certain areas while doing so...
 But a sinister organisation called Chrontek found a way to hack into Shiro&apos;s machine, and now Chrontek is pursuing its own devious plans for the flow of time...
 Can time travel be entrusted to humans?
 What happens when the Time Window goes wrong?
 And can the Time Tenshi stop the girls of Chrontek... before history is changed forever?  -- -- --
 Time Tenshi is an exciting anime/ecchi visual novel! As the player&apos;s character enters Tensai Shiro&apos;s lab facility and follows the Time Tenshi in their journeys through time, a plot full of futuristic action, ecchi, humour and plenty of fanservice will unfold!						</project:description>
