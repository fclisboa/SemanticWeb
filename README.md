# SemanticWeb

This project uses concepts from Semantic Web to make a game library browser where a user can search for games without neding to know the game title. The user can make queries like "games from developer X" or "games released before X year" and get results accordingly. All the games are retrieved directly from the Steam website.
To run the project run:
```python
python gameserver.py
```
